# Ned Beg

Based on a draft of "Tooilley Liorish Ned Beg Hom Ruy" by Rob Teare. Item numbers in the document refer to the draft.

The normalised versions, translations and diplomatic transcriptions are done by R Teare, with the exception of the diplomatic transcription Yn Yeean Thunnag Graney, which was transcribed by Christopher (Custhal) Lewin. 

In the case of notebooks, the pieces are grouped according to order they appear in in the original book. In the case of loose papers (pabyryn foshlit) the pieces are arranged in date order if a date is given, or in the order in which they have been kept within their folder. In the case of letters and newspaper articles, the pieces are presented in chronological order. The books and collections of loose papers and letters are ordered loosely by the first dated piece of writing and the average date of subsequent entries.
