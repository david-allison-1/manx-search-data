Down The Rabbit-Hole,Sheese sy Towl-Conning ,
"     Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. ",     Va Ealish cheet dy ve feer skee liorish soie marish e shuyr er y vroogh as veg eck ry-yannoo: ,
"Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”","Keayrt ny ghaa v’ee er speeikey sy lioar va’n chuyr eck lhaih, agh cha row jallooyn ny co-loayrtyssyn ayn, “as cre’n feeuid t’ec lioar,” smooinee Ealish, “fegooish jallooyn ny co-loayrtyssyn?” ",
"     So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.","     Er y hon shen v'ee sursmooinaght, syn aigney eck hene (chammah as v'ee abyl, er y fa dy row y laa cheh cur urree gennaghtyn feer chadlagh as bolvaneagh), beagh y taitnys jeh jannoo geuley-shee feeu y boirey jeh troggal urree as pluggey ny neayninyn, tra, dy doaltattym, roie Conning Vane as sooillyn jiarg-bane echey faggys jee. ",
"     There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ","     Cha row shen feer chronnalagh; as cha smooinee Ealish dy row eh feer whaagh dy chlashtyn y Chonning gra rish hene, ",
“Oh dear! Oh,“Atreih! Atreih! Bee'm ro anmagh!”,
dear! I shall be too late!”,,
"(when she thought about it afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural)","(tra smooinee ee er shoh ny s’anmagh, woaill y smooinaght ee dy lhisagh ee er ngoaill yindys jeh shoh, agh ec y traa shen v'eh ooilley sheiltyn dy row eh dooghyssagh dy liooar);",
"but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under the hedge. ","agh, tra ghow y Chonning ooreyder magh ass poggaid e vest as yeeagh eh er, as eisht jimmee eh roish dy tappee, lheim Ealish ny shassoo, er y fa dy jagh eh trooid e h-aigney nagh row ee rieau er vakin conning roie as poggaid-vest echey, ny ooreyder dy ghoaill magh ass noadyr, as, eeit seose lesh peeikearys, roie ee tessen y magher ny lurg, as v'ee kiart abyl fakin eh as eh goll roish sheese ayns towl-conning mooar va fo'n chleigh. ",
"     In another moment, down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.","     Ayns grig elley, hie Ealish sheese ny lurg, gyn smooinaght erbee sy teihll er yn aght veagh ee cosney magh ass reesht.",
"The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.","Va'n towl-conning jeeragh goll rish thiollane ec y toshiaght, as eisht v'eh goll sheese dy doaltattym, cho doaltattym as nagh row tullagh ec Ealish dy smooinaghtyn er scuirr ee hene roish my row ee tuittym sheese red va goll rish chibbyrt feer dowin. ",
"     Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her, and to wonder what was going to happen next.","     Va’n chibbyrt feer dowin, er-nonney v’ee tuittym feer voal, er y fa dy row traa dy liooar eck dy yeeaghyn mygeayrt y mooee myr v'ee goll sheese, as dy smooinaghtyn cre veagh taghyrt lurg shen.",
"First, she tried to make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. ","Hoshiaght, phrow ee jeeaghyn sheese as fakin cre v'ee cheet huggey, agh v'eh ro ghorraghey dy 'akin red erbee: eisht, yeeagh ee er cheughyn y çhibbyrt as hug ee my ner dy row ad lhieent lesh cubbyrtyn as skellooyn-lioaragh: ayns shoh as ayns shid honnick ee caslyssyn-cheerey as jallooyn va croghit er kibbinyn. ",
"She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed. It was labeled “ORANGE MARMALADE,” but, to her great disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.","Ghow ee costrayl veih nane jeh ny skellooyn as ish goll shaghey: va lipaid er, “MARMALAID ORANJE,” agh v’ee mollit dy mooar er y fa dy row eh follym: cha row ee laccal lhiggey da’n chostrayl tuittym, er aggle dy jinnagh eh marroo peiagh ennagh oddagh ve foee, as, kyndagh rish shen, haink eh lhee eh y chur stiagh ayns nane jeh ny cubbyrtyn myr v’ee tuittym shaghey. ",
"      “Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home. ","      “Dy jarroo!” smooinee Ealish ree hene. ""Erreish dou v'er tuittym myr shoh, cha jeanym coontey veg jeh surlley sheese ny greeishyn! Nagh bee ad ooilley coontey mish y ve dunnal ayns y thie! ",
"Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house. (Which was very likely true).","Cammah, cha nyiarrins veg my e chione, eer dy duittins veih mullagh y thie!"" (Va feer liklee y ve firrinagh). ",
"     Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? ","     Sheese, sheese, sheese. Nagh beagh jerrey dy bragh er tuittym? ",
“I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud.,"“C’woad meeiley ta mee er duittym nish, ta mee smooinaghtyn?” dooyrt ee er ard.",
“I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.,"“Gyn ourys, ta mee roshtyn boayl ennagh ta faggys da mean y teihill.",
"Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—”","Lhig dou smooinaghtyn: veagh shen kiare thousane meeiley sheese, er lhiam —”",
" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) "," (er y fa, t’ou toiggal, dy row Ealish er nynsaghey shiartanse dy reddyn myr shoh ayns ny lessoonyn eck sy chamyr-scoill, as ga nagh row shoh ny chaa feer vie dy hoilshaghey y fys eck, er y hon nagh row peiagh ayn dy eaishtagh ree, ny yeih, she cliaghtey mie dy ghra eh reesht) ",
"“—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?”","“— she, shen mysh y foddid kiart — agh cre’n Lheead-Cruinney ny Lhiurid-Cruinney ta mee er roshtyn, ta mee smooinaghtyn?”",
"(Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)","(Cha row fys ec Ealish er y vun jeh Lheead- Cruinney ny jeh Lhiurid-Cruinney noadyr, agh v'ee coontey ad dy ve nyn vocklyn braew jesh dy ghra.) ",
     Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! ,"     Lurg tammylt, ghow ee toshiaght reesht. “Jeanym tuittym kiart trooid y teihll! ",
How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!,Nagh bee eh aitt dy heet magh mastey sleih ta shooyl as ny king oc heese!,
"The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ","Ny Noi-Woailley, er lhiam—” (v’ee beggan bwooiagh nagh row peiagh erbee geaishtagh, y keayrt shoh, er y fa nagh row eh sheeanal goll rish y fockle kiart noadyr) ",
"“—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”","“—agh shegin dou fenaght jeu cre'n ennym t'er y cheer, ta fys ayd. My sailliu, Venainstyr, nee yn Teelan Noa t'ayn? Ny yn Austrail?”",
(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?),"As phrow ee dy yannoo curtshee as ish loayrt -— smooinee er shen, curtshee as oo tuittym trooid yn aer! Vel oo smooinaghtyn dy voddagh oo jannoo eh?)",
“And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! ,“As nagh jean ee smooinaghtyn dy nee inneen veg almoragh mish son briaght! ,
"No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”",Cha bee eh cooie dy vriaght: foddee dy vaikym eh screeut seose boayl ennagh.” ,
"     Down, down, down! There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking to herself. ","     Sheese, sheese, sheese. Cha row veg elley ry yannoo, as, er y hon shen, ghow Ealish toshiaght dy loayrt reesht. ",
"“Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!” (Dinah was the cat.)","“Gowee Dinah foddeeaght er my hon noght, er lhiam!” (She yn kayt va Dinah.)",
"“I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear, I wish you were down here with me!”",“Ta mee treishteil dy bee cooinaghtyn oc er e skaal dy vainney ec traa-tey. Dinah veen! Saillym dy row uss heese ayns shoh marym!”,
"There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. ","Cha nel lughee syn aer, s’doogh lhiam, agh foddee dy voddagh oo tayrtyn craitnag, as ta shen kiart goll rish lugh, ta fys ayd.",
"But do cats eat bats, I wonder?","Agh vel ny kiyt gee ny craitnagyn, ta mee smooinaghtyn?” ",
"And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, ","As er-shen haink Ealish dy ve beggan cadlagh, as hie ee er as ish gra ree hene er aght ashlishagh, ",
"“Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?”","“Vel ny kiyt gee ny craitnagyn? Vel ny kiyt gee ny craitnagyn?” as ny keayrtyn, “Vel ny craitnagyn gee ny kiyt?”",
"for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. ","as, er y hon, t’ou toiggal, nagh dod ee cur ansoor da ny feyshtyn, by chummey yn feysht v’ee dy vriaght. ",
"She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?”","V’ee gennaghtyn myr dy beagh cadley cheet urree, as v'ee er ngoaill toshiaght dy ghreamal dy row ee shooyl laue ry laue marish Dinah, as dy row ee gra ree er aght feer jeean, “Nish, Dinah, insh dou yn ’irriney: dee uss craitnag rieau?”",
"when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.","tra, dy doaltattym, polt! polt! sheese lhee er carnane dy vaidjyn as duillagyn chirrym, as cha row ee tuittym arragh. ",
"     Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. ","     Cha row Ealish gortit noadyr, as lheim ee seose ny shassoo ayns tullagh: yeeagh ee seose, agh v’eh ooilley dorraghey erskyn eck: sheeyney magh roee va thiollane liauyr elley, as vaʼn Chonning Vane foast ry akin, as eshyn goll sheese dy bieau sy thiollane. ",
There was not a moment to be lost. ,Cha row traa erbee ry yummal: ,
"Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner,","ersooyl lesh Ealish goll rish y gheay, as v’ee kiart abyl clashtyn eh gra, as eshyn goll mygeayrt corneil, ",
"“Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"" She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.","“Ogh, my chleayshyn as robaigyn, s'anmagh t'eh gaase!"" V'ee faggys da, ny chooyl, tra hie ee mygeayrt y chorneil, agh cha row y Chonning ry akin arragh:",
"she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.","hug ee my ner dy row ee ayns halley injil, liauyr, va jeant gial liorish roa dy lostanyn va soiet ayns y chlea. ",
"There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.","Va dorryssyn ooilley mygeayrt y halley, agh v'ad ooilley glast: as tra va Ealish er ngoll ooilley yn raad sheese er un cheu as seose yn cheu elley, as ish prowal gagh dorrys, hooill ee dy trimshagh sheese y vean, smooinaghtyn er aght erbee dy chosney magh ass dy bragh. ",
"     Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. ","     Dy doaltattym, haink ee gys boayrd beg tree-chassagh, ooilley jeant ass gless stooalt: cha row veg er agh ogher vinniagagh airhey, as smooinee Ealish hoshiaght dy row shoh lesh nane jeh ny dorryssyn sy halley; agh, atreih! va ny glish ro vooar, ny va'n ogher ro veg, agh, aghterbee, cha voshlagh ee fer erbee jeu. ",
"However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!","Ny yei, er y nah hurrys, haink ee gys curtan injil nagh row ee er chur my ner roie. Cheu-heear jeh va dorrys beg va mysh queig oarlagh jeig er yrjid: phrow ee yn ogher veg airhey sy ghlass, as v'ee jeant feer wooiagh tra hie ee stiagh! ",
"     Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. ",     Doshil Ealish y dorrys as hooar ee magh dy row raad ayns shen gys thiollane beg nagh row foddey ny smoo na towl-roddan: ghlioon ee sheese as yeeagh ee trooid y thiollane stiagh sy gharey s'aaley honnick oo rieau.,
"How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. ","S'mooar va’n foddeeaght urree dy scapail veih'n halley dorraghey shen as rouail mygeayrt trooid ny h-immraghyn shen dy vlaaghyn daahoil as ny farraneyn feayr shen, agh cha dod ee eer cur e kione trooid y dorrys; “as eer dy ragh my chione ny hrooid,” smooinee Ealish voght, “cha beagh eh feeu fegooish my gheayltyn.

"Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.” ","Oh, dy row mee abyl dooney seose goll rish fodreayrtan! Er lhiam dy noddin, dy beagh fys aym er yn aght dy ghoaill toshiaght.""",
"For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.","T’ou toiggal, va whilleen reddyn quaagh er daghyrt er y gherrit dy row Ealish smooinaght dy row reddyn va dy firrinagh neu-yantagh feer ghoan dy jarroo. ",
"     There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.","     V’eh sheiltyn nagh row eh feeu dy ve fuirraghtyn ec y dorrys beg, as hie ee reesht gys y voayrd, as ish lieh-hreishteil dy voghe ee ogher elley er, foddee, er nonney, er y chooid sloo, lioar dy reillyn ry-hoi dooney sleih seose goll rish fodreayrtan: y keayrt shoh, hooar ee boteil veg er (""nagh row ayns shoh roie, son shickyrys,"" dooyrt Ealish), as kianlt mygeayrt y mysh mwannal y voteil va lipaid pabyrey as ny focklyn ""IU MEE"" clouit urree dy h-aalin ayns lettyryn mooarey. ",

" “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: ","“Cha jeanym, nee’m jeeaghyn hoshiaght,” dooyrt ee, “as jeeaghyn vel eh cowrit ‘nieu’ ny dyn”; myr v’ee er lhaih shiartanse dy skeealyn beggey jesh mychione paitchyn ren cheet dy ve loshtit, as eeit seose ec beishtyn oaldey, as reddyn neu-haitnyssagh elley, er y fa nagh dod ad freayll cooinaghtyn er ny reillyn neu-ghoillee va ny caarjyn oc er nynsaghey daue: ",
"such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.","myr sampleyr, nee brod-yiarn jiarg-loshtee oo y lostey my t’ou goaill greim er ro foddey; as, my t’ou giarrey dty vair feer dowin lesh skynn, dy cliaghtagh t’ee lhiggey fuill; as cha row ee rieau er nyarrood, my t'ou giu ram veih boteil ta cowrit “nieu”, t’eh bunnys shickyr dy jean eh tuittym magh lhiat sy jerrey. ",
"     However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.","     Agh cha row y voteil shoh cowrit “nieu”, as myr shen ventyr Ealish dy vlasstyn er, as, er y fa dy row eh feer jesh (dy jarroo, va sorch dy vlass mestit echey, goaill stiagh pie-shillish, custart, annane, kellagh frangagh rostit, taffee, as arran-greddan cheh as eeym er), d'ee ee seose eh feer tappee. ",
      “What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a telescope.”,      “Cre’n ennaghtyn quaagh!” dooyrt Ealish. “Gyn ourys ta mee dooney seose goll rish fodreayrtan!” ,
"     And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.

",
"First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?” ","Agh, hoshiaght, duirree ish shiartanse dy vinnidyn dy 'eddyn magh beagh ee cheet dy ve ny sloo foast: va beggan dy aggle urree roish shoh; “er y fa dy noddagh eh cheet gy kione, ta fys ayd,” dooyrt Ealish ree hene, “as mish goll er mooghey dy bollagh, goll rish cainle.

"And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.","As phrow ee dy heiltyn cre goll rish ta lossey y chainle erreish da'n chainle v'er sheidit magh, er yn oyr nagh dod ee cooinaghtyn dy vaik ee y lheid rieau. ",
"     After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!","     Lurg tammylt, tra hooar ee magh nagh row veg elley taghyrt, smooinee ish dy ragh ee stiagh sy gharey er y chooyl; agh atreih, Ealish voght!",
"When she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it:","Tra haink ee gys y dorrys, hooar ee magh dy row ee er nyarrood ogher veg y gharee, as tra haink ee reesht gys y voayrd dy gheddyn ee, cha dod ee geddyn ee noadyr:",
"she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.","V’ee abyl fakin ee dy cronnal trooid y ghless, as ren ee e cooid share dy ghrappal seose nane jeh ny lurgaghyn jeh’n voayrd, agh v'eh ro shliawin; as tra v'ee jeant skee lesh yn eab, hoie y red beg sheese as huitt ee er keayney.  ",
"      “Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” ","      “Trog ort, cha neeu eh y ve keayney myr shen!” dooyrt Ealish ree hene gear dy liooar. “Ta mee cur coyrle dhyt dy chur kione er nish!”",
"She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.","V’ee cliaghtey cur coyrle vie jee hene (ga nagh row ee cur geill jee dy mennick), as ny keayrtyn ren ee troiddey ee hene cho olk as dy row eh cur jeiryn ayns e sooillyn; as keayrt dy row, va cooinaghtyn eck dy phrow ee bassag y chur da ny cleayshyn eck hene er y fa dy chloie ee branglash ayns gamman dy chroquet v'ee cloie ny lomarcan, er y hon dy row y paitchey quaagh shoh feer ghraihagh er lhiggey er dy row daa pheiagh aynjee.",
"“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!”","“Agh cha neeu eh nish,” smooinee Ealish voght, “dy lhiggey er dy vel daa pheiagh aynym! Cammah, cha nod oo gra dy vel dy liooar jeem faagit dy yannoo un pheiagh ta feeu!” ",
"     Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. ","     Dy gerrid, yeeagh ee er kishtey beg gless va ny lhie fo'n voayrd: doshil ee eh, as aynsyn hooar ee berreen feer veg as ny focklyn ""EE MEE"" screeut er dy h-aalin lesh curranyn. ",
"“Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”","“Dy jarroo, eeym eh,” dooyrt Ealish, “as my vees eh cur orrym gaase ny smoo, foddym roshtyn yn ogher; as my vees eh cur orrym gaase ny sloo, foddym snaue fo’n voayrd: myr shen, nee'm cosney stiagh sy gharey as s'cummey lhiams cre vees taghyrt!” ",
"     She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which way?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: ","     Dee ee minniag, as dooyrt ee dy h-imneagh ree hene “Cre’n raad? Cre’n raad?”, as ish cur laue er mullagh e kione dy ’eddyn cre’n raad v’ee gaase; as va yindys dy liooar urree feddyn magh dy hannee ee y mooadys cheddin. ",
"to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.","Son shickyrys, shoh yn red ta cliaghtey taghyrt tra t’ou gee berreen; agh va Ealish er jeet dy ve cho cliaghtit rish jerkal rish taghyrtyn neu-chadjin as dy row eh sheiltyn dree as bolvaneagh dy liooar my va'n vea goll er er yn aght cadjin. ",
"     So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.","     Myr shen, ghow ee yn obbyr ayns laue, as ayns tammylt beg va'n berreen eeit eck. ",

"      “Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, thatfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!

"I’m sure I shan’t be able!

"Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”","Atreih, cre’n boghtynid ta mee taggloo!”",
"     Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.","     Kiart ec y traa shoh, woaill e kione noi clea yn halley: dy jarroo, v'ee beggan ny smoo na nuy trie er yrjid nish, as dy chelleeragh ghow ee yn ogher veg airhey as ersooyl lhee gys dorrys y gharee. ",
"     Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.","     Ealish voght!

"It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, ","She y Chonning Vane va cheet reesht, va coamrit dy stoamey, as piyr dy laueanyn-mannan baney ayns un laue as feayragan mooar sy laue elley: v’eh troytal feer tappee, as, myr v’eh cheet, v’eh tallaghey rish hene, ",

"Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!

"She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.","Dirree ee seose as hie ee gys y voayrd dy howse ee hene liorish, as hooar ee magh, as ish cur cheb er, dy row ee mysh daa hrie er yrjid nish: dy gerrid, hooar ee magh dy row y feayragan v’ayns y laue y bun jeh shoh, as lhig ee da tuittym dy tappee, dy jeeragh ayns traa dy hauail ee hene veih cribbey ersooyl dy bollagh. ",

"     Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.","     Eisht cheayll ee red ennagh va skeolley sy dubbey faggys dy liooar jee, as snaue ee ny sniessey da dy ’eddyn magh c’red v’eh: hoshiaght, smooinee ish dy beagh eh ny choo-marrey ny cabbyl-awin, agh eisht va cooinaghtyn eck dy row eh feer veg, as dy gerrid hoig ee dy nee lugh v'ayn, skyrr stiagh goll ree hene. ",

"The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.","Dy doaltattym, lheim y Lugh magh ass yn ushtey as v’eh jeeaghyn dy row ee er craa lesh aggle.",
" “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.”"," “Oh, gow my leshtal,” dyllee Ealish dy siyragh, as ish goaill aggle dy row ee er chur yn olk er y chretoor boght. “Yarrood mee dy bollagh nagh mie lhiat ny kiyt.” ",

"I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.

“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!”,“S’doogh dy vel mee er chur yn olk urree reesht!”,

"When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”","Tra cheayll y Lugh shoh, hyndaa ee mygeayrt as snaue ee erash huic dy moal: v'ee bane-eddinagh dy liooar (v’ee jiarg chorree, smooinee Ealish), as dooyrt ee, ayns coraa injil va er craa, “Lhig dooin goll gys y traie, as inshym dhyt my skeeal, as toiggee oo yn oyr dy vel mee cur feoh da kiyt as moddee.”",
"     It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.","     Son shickyrys, v'eh traa dy gholl, er y fa dy row y dubbey cheet dy ve lane dy liooar kyndagh rish ny h-ushagyn as beiyn va er duittym stiagh ayn: va Thunnag as Dodo ayns shen, Loree as Eean-urley, as shiartanse dy chretooryn elley.

"They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.","Dy jarroo, she sheshaght whaagh ren chaglym er y vroogh - ny h-ushagyn as fedjagyn dragagh oc, ny beiyn as y fynney oc lhiantyn feer faggys daue, as gagh nane jeu fliugh baiht, corree as mee-gherjoilagh. ",
"      The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life.","      Y chied feysht, dy dooghyssagh, va shen cre'n aght dy heet dy ve çhirrym reesht: va co-choyrle eddyr oc mysh shoh, as lurg minnid ny ghaa, va Ealish coontey eh dooghyssagh dy liooar dy ve loayrt roo er aght caarjoil, myr dy beagh enney er ve eck orroo car e bea.

"Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am older than you, and must know better;” ","Dy jarroo, huitt ee magh rish traa dy liooar lesh y Loree, ren cheet dy ve pooitchagh as nagh nyiarragh agh “Ta mish ny shinney na uss as shegin fys share ve aym.” ",

"The question is, what did the archbishop find?”",Shoh yn feysht: cre hooar yn ardaspick?” ,

"       “What is a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.","       “Cre ta Ratch-kaakys?” dooyrt Ealish; dy firrinagh, cha row ee laccal feddyn magh, agh va'n Dodo er scuirr myr dy beagh eh smooinaghtyn dy lhisagh peiagh ennagh gra red ennagh, as cha row beoyn er peiagh ennagh elley gra red erbee. ",

"      This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.

CHAPTER IV.,CABDYL 4 ,
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill,Ta'n Chonning Cur Stiagh Illiam Beg ,
"     It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself “The Duchess! ","     She y Chonning Vane v’ayn, va troytal erash reesht dy moal, as eshyn jeeaghyn mygeayrt y mysh dy h-imneagh myr v'eh goll, myr dy beagh red ennagh caillt echey; as cheayll ee eh loayrt dy h-injil rish hene, “Y Vendiuic!

"The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!","Y Vendiuic! Ogh my vaaigyn veen! Ogh y fynney as ny robaigyn aym! Bee’m currit gy baase eck, cho shickyr as dy vel ferradyn nyn verradyn!",
"Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?” ","C’raad oddins er lhiggey daue tuittym, ta mee smooinaghtyn?” ",
,,
"Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen","Heill Ealish ayns grig dy row eh shirrey y feayragan as y piyr dy laueanyn-mannan baney, as dy doaieagh ghow ee toshiaght dy hirrey ad, agh cha row ad ry akin boayl erbee ",
"— everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.","— v’eh jeeaghyn dy row dy chooilley nhee caghlaait neayr’s y traa v’ee snaue sy dubbey; as y halley mooar, lesh y voayrd-gless as y dorrys beg, v’ad er skellal roish dy bollagh. ",
"     Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.","     Feer leah, hug y Chonning Ealish my ner, myr v'ee shirrey noon as noal, as dyllee eh magh ree lesh coraa corree, ""Cammah, Voirrey Ann, cre sy teihll t'ou uss jannoo mooie ayns shoh?

"“     He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran.","      “Heill eh dy row mish yn inney-veyl echey,” dooyrt ee ree hene as ish roie. ",
" “How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.”","“Nagh bee yindys er tra vees eh feddyn magh quoi mish hene! Agh bare dou cur lhiam huggey y feayragan as ny laueanyn echey - ta shen dy ghra, my ’oddym feddyn ad.”",
,,
"As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. ","Myr dooyrt ee shoh, haink ee gys thie beg skeoigh, as er dorrys y thie va plait prashey gial as yn ennym “I. CONNING” grainnit er. ",
"She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.","Hie ee stiagh fegooish crankal, as hiyree ee seose ny greeishyn, er aggle dy jinnagh ee meeiteil rish y Voirrey Ann firrinagh as dy beagh ee ceaut magh ass y thie roish my dooar ee y feayragan as ny laueanyn. ",
"      “How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for a rabbit!","      “Nagh quaagh t’eh sheiltyn,” dooyrt Ealish ree hene, “dy ve jannoo chaghteraghtyn da conning!",
I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” ,Ta mee sheiltyn dy bee Dinah cur orrym jannoo chaghteraghtyn jeeish lurg shoh!”,
And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen:,Ghow Ealish toshiaght dy smooinaghtyn er y torch dy red haghyragh:,
" “‘Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!’ "," “Inneen Ealish! Tar dys shoh nish, as jean uss hene aarloo son dty hooyl!’",
"‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ ","‘Ta mee cheet ayns minnid, voandyr! Agh shegin dou freayll rick er y towl-lugh shoh gys hig Dinah erash, as jeeaghyn dou hene nagh jean y lugh cosney magh ass.’ ",
"Only I don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!”","Agh cha nel mee sheiltyn,” hie Ealish er, “dy lhiggagh ad da Dinah tannaghtyn sy thie dy jinnagh ee goaill toshiaght dy chur oardaghyn da sleih myrshen!” ",
"     By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: ","     Ec y traa shoh, v’ee er ngeddyn y raad stiagh ayns shamyr veg skeoigh as boayrd syn uinnag, as er y voayrd (myr v'ee treishteil), va feayragan as ghaa ny tree piyryn dy laueanyn-mannan baney minniagagh: ",
"she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.","ghow ee greim er y feayragan as piyr dy laueanyn, as v'ee er chee faagail y shamyr tra hug ee my ner boteil veg va ny shassoo faggys da'n ghless-huarystal.",
"There was no label this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. ","Y keayrt shoh, cha row lipaid ayn as ny fockleyn ""IU MEE” urree, agh ny yeih shen, ghow ee yn eairkey ass as hug ish ee da ny meillyn eck.",
"“I know something interesting is sure to happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what this bottle does.","“Ta fys aym dy vel eh shickyr dy jean red ennagh taghyrt,” dooyrt ee ree hene, “traa erbee ta mee gee ny giu red erbee: myr shen, yiowym magh cre vees jeant ec y voteil shoh. ",
"I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”",Ta treisht aym dy der eh orrym gaase mooar reesht er y fa dy vel mee slane skee as mish my red beg minniagagh!” ,
,,
"     It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. ","     Ren eh shen dy jarroo, as foddey ny s'leaie na v'ee jerkal: roish my row ee er niu lieh voteil, hooar ee dy row e kione traastey noi'n far-woalley, as beign j’ee croymmey sheese dy haghney mwannal brisht. ",
"She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough — I hope I shan’t grow any more — As it is, I can’t get out at the door — I do wish I hadn’t drunk quite so much!”","Hug ee sheese y voteil dy tappee as ish gra ree hene “S’liooar shen — ta mee treishteil nagh naaseym ny smoo — Ec y traa t'ayn, cha noddym goll trooid y dorrys — saillym nagh row wheesh iut aym!” ",
"     Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.","     Atreih!

"Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?”","V’ee gaase foast, as, myr eab jerrinagh, hug ee un roih magh ass yn uinnag, as un chass seose y chimlee, as dooyrt ee ree hene “Nish cha noddym jannoo ny smoo, cre erbee vees taghyrt. Cre’n erree hig orrym?” ",
,,
"     Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.","     Va Ealish aighoil: cha row ny smoo bree faagit sy voteil veg obbee, as cha daase ee ny smoo: ny yeih, v'eh feer vee-gherjoilagh, as, myr v'eh jeeaghyn nagh row caa erbee eck scapail veih'n chamyr reesht dy bragh, cha nhyrrys dy row trimshey urree.

"“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. ","“V’eh foddey ny s’taitnyssee ec y thie,” smooinee Ealish voght, “raad nagh row uss kinjagh gaase ny smoo as ny sloo, as goll er oardaghey liorish lughee as conneeyn.",
"I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole —and yet — and yet — it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! ","Ta mee bunnys guee nagh row mee er ngoll sheese y towl-conning shen — as foast — as foast — t’eh quaagh dy liooar, ta fys ayd, y sorch shoh dy vea!",

"When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!","Tra va mee lhaih skeealyn-ferrish, heill mee nagh ren y lheid rieau taghyrt, as nish shoh mee hene sy vean jeh skeeal-ferrish!",
"There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one — but I’m grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more here.”","Dy jarroo, lhisagh lioar ve scruit my my chione! As tra vees mee aasit, screeuym nane — agh ta mee aasit nish,” as dooyrt ee lesh coraa treih: “er y chooid sloo, cha nel reamys ayns shoh dy aase ny smoo.”",
"      “But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get any older than I am now? ","      “Agh eisht,” smooinee Ealish, “nagh jigym dy ve ny shinney na ta mish ec y traa t'ayn? ",
"That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman — but then — always to have lessons to learn! ","Bee shen mie, er aght ennagh — dyn y ve my henn ven dy bragh — agh eisht — lessoonyn ayms son dy bragh ry ynsaghey! ",
"Oh, I shouldn’t like that!”","Ogh, cha beigns graihagh er shen!”",

“How can you learn lessons in here? ,“Cre'n aght oddys oo jannoo lessoonyn ayns shoh?,
"Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all for any lesson-books!”","Cammah, s’goan y reamys dhyt hene, as cha nel reamys erbee da lioaryn-lessoon!” ",
"     And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.","     As v’ee goll er myr shen, gra yn derrey yeh as yn jeh elley, as jannoo coloayrtys mie dy liooar jeh; agh lurg shiartanse dy vinnidyn, cheayll ee coraa cheu-mooie, as scuirr ee dy eaishtagh. ",
      “Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”,      “Voirrey Ann! Voirrey Ann!” dooyrt y coraa. “Cur lhiat dou my laueanyn dy chelleeragh!”,
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. ,Eisht va clabberaght veg jeh maaigyn er ny greeishyn.,
"Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.","Va fys ec Ealish dy row shen y Chonning va er jeet dy hirrey ee, as v’ee goll er craa gys va'n thie goll er craa, as ish jarrood dy row ee nish red goll rish thousane keayrt cho mooar as y Chonning, as cha row oyr erbee eck dy ghoaill aggle roish. ",
,,
"     Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.

Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll go round and get in at the window.”,Cheayll Ealish dy dooyrt eh rish hene “Hem mygeayrt as neeym cosney stiagh ec yn uinnag.” ,
"“That you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.

,,
"She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.","Cha dooar ee greim er red erbee, agh cheayll ee screeagh beg as red ennagh tuittym, as polt dy ghless vrisht, as veih shen hoig ee dy row eh jantagh dy row eh er duittym stiagh ayns frame-cucowr, ny red ennagh myr shen. ",

"     There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”","     Haink tostid dowin dy chelleeragh, as smooinee Ealish ree hene ""Cre nee ad nish, ta mee sheiltyn!

"      “A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.","      “Barrey lane dy c’red?” smooinee Ealish.

"“I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that again!” which produced another dead silence.","“Verym jerrey er shoh,” dooyrt ee ree hene, as dyllee ee magh, “Bare diu dyn jannoo shen reesht!”, as va tostid dowin elley ayn.",
"Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head.","Hug Ealish my ner, as yindys dy liooar urree, dy row ooilley ny mynchlaghyn cheet dy ve nyn merreenyn beggey, nyn lhie er y laare, as haink eie mie stiagh ayns e kione.

"“If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.”","“My eeym nane jeh ny berreenyn shoh,” smooinee ish “t’eh shickyr dy bee eh caghlaa my vooadys er aght ennagh; as, er y fa nagh vod eh cur orrym ve ny smoo, shegin da cur orrym ve ny sloo, ta mee sheiltyn.” ",

"They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.","Hiyree ad gys Ealish cho leah's haink ee ree; agh roie ee ersooyl cho tappee as dod ee, as dy gerrid v'ee sauchey ayns keyll gloo. ",
"      “The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.","      “Y chied red shegin dou jannoo,” dooyrt Ealish ree hene as ish rouail sy cheyll, “shen gaase gys my vooadys kiart reesht; as y nah red, shen feddyn y raad stiagh sy gharey aalin shen.

I think that will be the best plan.”,Ta mee sheiltyn dy bee shen y plan share.”,
"     It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.","     V’eh sheeanal goll rish plan mie er bashtal, gyn ourys, as reaghit feer jesh as aashagh: yn ynrican doilleeid bentyn rish, cha row yn eie sloo eck cre’n aght dy ghoaill eh ayns laue; as, choud as v’ee speeikey dy h-imneagh mastey ny biljyn, ren gounstyrnee beg gear kiart erskyn e kione cur urree jeeaghyn seose dy siyragh. ",

"     An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. ","     Va quallian gloutagh jeeaghyn neose urree lesh sooillyn mooarey cruinn, as, sheeyney magh un vaaig dy faase, v’eh prowal dy ventyn ree. ",
"“Poor little thing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.","“Y red beg boght!” dooyrt Ealish lesh coraa cleaynagh, as phrow ee dy niartal dy ’eddanagh huggey; agh v’ee goaill aggle atchimagh car y traa dy row accrys er, foddee, as er y hon shen dy beagh eh liklee dy neeagh eh seose ee, ga dy row ee shirrey cleayney y quallian. ",
"     Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; ","     Cha row fys kiart eck cre ren ee, agh ghow ee greim er maidjey beg, as heeyn ee magh eh gys y whallian: er shen, daag ooilley ny maaigyn jeh'n whallian y thalloo ec yn un cheayrt as eh lheim seose lesh screeagh dy ard-voggey, as hiyree eh gys y vaidjey, as lhig eh er dy row eh soie er:, ",
"then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; ","eisht hug Ealish ee hene cheu-heear jeh onnane mooar dy tappee, dy haghney ish y ve bwoaillt sheese;as, cho leah’s haink ee ree er y cheu elley, roie y quallian dy tappee gys y vaidjey reesht, as huitt eh gour e ching sy driss dy gheddyn greim er: ",
"then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.","eisht, roie Ealish mygeayrt y mysh yn onnane reesht, as ish coontey eh y ve kiart goll rish gamman marish cabbyl mooar, raad v'ee smooinaghtyn gagh minnid dy beagh ee sthampit fo ny hingnyn echey: eisht ghow y quallian toshiaght dy roie reesht as reesht noi'n vaidjey, roie raad feer veg er e hoshiaght gagh keayrt as raad feer liauyr ergooyl, as eh gounstyrnee dy peeaghaneagh car y traa, gys, fy yerrey, hoie eh sheese foddey dy liooar ersooyl, as eh pandoogh, lesh e hengey cheet magh ass e veeal as e hooillyn mooarey lieh dooint.",
"This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.","Heill Ealish dy row shoh ny chaa mie dy scapail: myr shen, hie ee roee dy çhelleeragh, as ren ee roie derrey v'ee skee dy liooar as ass ennal, as va gounstyrnee y whallian sheeanal faase dy liooar sy foddid. ",
"      “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: ","      “As ny yeih, cre’n quallian beg meen v’ayn!” dooyrt Ealish, as ish lieh-lhie er cass fannag dy ghoaill fea, as fasney ee hene lesh nane jeh ny duillagyn.",

"     The great question certainly was, what? ","     Dy jarroo, she C’red? va’n feysht mooar. ",
"Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.","Yeeagh Ealish ooilley mygeayrt y mooee er ny blaaghyn as ny hoashyryn dy ’aiyr, agh cha dod ee fakin red erbee va jeeaghyn goll rish y red kiart dy ee ny iu lesh y tuittymys v’ayn.",
"There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.","Va shalmane mooar gaase faggys jee, mysh yn yrjid cheddin as ee hene; as, tra v’ee er nyeeaghyn fo, as er gagh lhiattee jeh, as cheu-heear jeh, heill ee dy bare jee jeeaghyn as feddyn magh c'red v’er y vaare jeh. ",
"     She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.","     Heeyn ish ee hene seose er baare e h-ordaagyn-coshey, as ren ee peeikearagh harrish oirr y chalmane, as dy çhelleeragh veeit e sooillyn roosyn ec praddag vooar ghorrym, va ny soie er y vaare as e roihaghyn fillit, toghtaney hookah liauyr dy feagh, dyn geill y chur jeeish ny da red erbee elley. ",
CHAPTER V.,CABDYL 5 ,
Advice from a Caterpillar,Coyrle voish Praddag ,
"     The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.","     Yeeagh y Phraddag as Ealish er y cheilley rish tammylt ayns tostid: fy yerrey, ghow y Phraddag y hookah magh ass e beeal, as loayr ee ree ayns coraa liastey, cadlagh. ",
      “Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.,      “Quoi uss?” dooyrt y Phraddag. ,
"     This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I — I hardly know, sir, just at present — at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”","     Cha row shoh greinnaghey ee as y coloayrtys goaill toshiaght.

      “What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself!”,      “C’red ta’n bun jeh shen?” dooyrt y Phraddag dy loghtal. “Soilshee magh oo hene!” ,
"      “I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”","      “Cha noddym soilshaghey magh mee hene, s’treih lhiam gra, Vainstyr,” dooyrt Ealish, “er y fa nagh nee mish hene mish, t’ou toiggal.” ",
"      “I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.","      “Cha nel mee toiggal,” dooyrt y Phraddag. ",
"      “I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely, “for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”","      “S’treih lhiam, agh cha noddym gra eh ny smoo baghtal,” dreggyr Ealish, feer chooyrtoil, er y fa nagh voddyms hene toiggal eh, dy ghoaill toshiaght; as lurg dou ve whilleen mooadys ayns un laa, t’eh er chur orrym ve fud y cheilley dy bollagh.” ",

"      “Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you have to turn into a chrysalis — you will some day, you know — and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?”","      “Foddee nagh vel y lheid er jeet orts foast,” dooyrt Ealish; “agh tra vees oo eginit caghlaa gys cryslaid — bee uss eginit laa ennagh, ta fys ayd — as lurg shen, gys foillycan, veigns smooinaghtyn dy bee uss gennaghtyn red beg quaagh, nagh bee?”",

      “You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are you?”,      “Uss!” dooyrt y Phraddag dy lunagh. “Quoi uss?” ,
     Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. ,     Ren shen cur ad erash dys toshiaght y choloayrtys. ,
"Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.”","Va raaghyn feer yiare ny Praddag cur er Ealish dy ve beggan brasnit, as hayrn ee ee hene seose as dooyrt ee, feer trome-chooishagh, “Er lhiam dy lhisagh uss ginsh dooys quoi oo hene hoshiaght.” ",
      “Why?” said the Caterpillar.,      “Cre’n oyr?” dooyrt y Phraddag. ,
"     Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.","     Er hoh feysht boiragh elley; as, er y fa nagh dod Ealish smooinaghtyn er oyr mie erbee, as v'eh jeeaghyn dy row aigney ny Praddag ayns stayd feer neu-haitnyssagh, hyndaa ee ee hene ersooyl.

"      “No,” said the Caterpillar.","      “Cha nel,” dooyrt y Phraddag. ",

"Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, “One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.”","Eisht haink ee neose veih’n chalmane, as ren ee snaue ersooyl stiagh sy faiyr, as ish gra myr v'ee goll, “Ver un lhiattee ort dy aase ny s'toallee, as ver y lhiattee elley ort dy ve ny s'girrey.” ",
      “One side of what? The other side of what?” thought Alice to herself.,      “Un lhiattee jeh c’red? Y lhiattee elley jeh c’red?” smooinee Ealish ree hene.,
"      “Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.","      “Jeh’n chalmane,” dooyrt y Phraddag, myr dy beagh ee er vriaght er ard; as ayns grig elley v’ee ass shilley. ",
"     Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. ","     Hannee Ealish as ish jeeaghyn er y chalmane dy smooinaghtagh rish minnid, prowal dy hoiggal y daa lhiattee jeh; as, er y fa dy row ee cruinn, hooar ee dy nee feysht doillee v’ayn. ",
"However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.","Aghterbee, sy jerrey heeyn ee e roihaghyn mygeayrt y mysh cho foddey as v’ad roshtyn, as vrish ee peesh jeh’n oirr lesh gagh laue. ",
"“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!","“Nish, cre’n pheesh ta kiart?” dooyrt ee ree hene, as huilg ee minniag veih'n lhiattee er y laue yesh dy ’eddyn magh cre haghyragh.

"     She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.","     V’ee agglit dy mooar liorish y caghlaa feer doaltattym shoh, agh dennee ish nagh row traa erbee faagit, er y fa dy row ee goll er cribbey dy bieau: myr shen, ghow ee ayns laue dy chelleeragh dy ee paart jeh’n pheesh elley.

"Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.","Va’n smeggyl eck traastit cho chionn noi e cass as nagh row monney reamys faagit dy ’osley e beeal; agh doshil ee eh fy yerrey, as haink eh lhee dy ‘luggey minniag jeh'n pheesh hoshtal. ",
"      “Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.","      “Jeeagh, ta’n kione aym seyr fy yerrey!” dooyrt Ealish as ard- voggey sy choraa eck, va caghlaait gys atchim ayns grig elley, tra hooar ee magh nagh row e geayltyn ry gheddyn boayl erbee: ooilley v’ee abyl fakin, tra yeeagh ee sheese, va shen lhiurid ass towse jeh mwannal, va jeeaghyn myr dy beagh eh girree goll rish gass ass keayn dy ghuillagyn glassey va nyn lhie foddey foee. ",
      “What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where have my shoulders got to? ,      “Cre sy teihll ta’n stoo glass shen?” dooyrt Ealish. “As c’raad ta my ghealtyn ersooyl? ,
"And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”","As ogh, my laueyn boghtey, cre’n aght nagh voddym fakin ad?”",
"She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.","V’ee gleashaghey ad mygeayrt as ish loayrt, agh v’eh jeeaghyn nagh row eiyrtys erbee ayn, er lhimmey jeh craa beg mastey ny duillagyn glassey feer foddey ersooyl. ",
"      As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.

",
"She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.","V’eh er jeet lhee dy loobey sheese e mwannal dy h-aalin camstram, as ish er chee lheim stiagh mastey ny duillagyn, nagh row agh baareyn ny biljyn v’ee rouail fo, tra hug thassane gear urree tayrn ergooyl dy siyragh: va calmane mooar er netlagh stiagh syn eddin eck, as v’eh bwoalley ee dy h-eulyssagh lesh e skianyn. ",

"        “Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!”","        “Aarnieu, ta mish dy ghra reesht!” dooyrt y Calmane reesht, agh ayns coraa va ny smoo kiune, as dooyrt eh lesh sorch dy hogh, “Ta mee er phrowal gagh aght, agh t'eh jeeaghyn nagh vel veg cooie daue!” ",

"        “I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those serpents!

"        “As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!

"        “And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”","        “As cho leah’s ta mee er ngoaill y billey syrjey sy cheyll,” hie y Calmane er, as eh troggal e choraa seose gys screeagh, “as kiart ec y traa va mee sheiltyn dy beigns rey roo fy yerrey, shegin daue cheet neose veih’n speyr as ad cassey mygeayrt!

"        “I — I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.","        “Ta- ta mee my inneen veg,” dooyrt Ealish ouryssagh dy liooar, myr va cooinaghtyn eck er ny caghlaaghyn earrooagh haink urree y laa shen. ",

,,
"       This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, ","       Va shoh ny eie noa niartal son Ealish, as, kyndagh rish, v'ee ny tost rish minnid ny ghaa, ren cur da'n Chalmane y caa dy ghra, ",

"       Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it.","       Chroym Ealish sheese mastey ny biljyn chammah as dod ee, er y fa dy row e mwannal kinjagh cheet dy ve kianlt seose ayns ny banglaneyn, as nish as reesht beign jee scuirr dy ’easyley eh.",
"After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.","Lurg tammylt, va cooinaghtyn eck dy row ee foast cummal greim er ny peeshyn jeh shalmane ayns e laueyn, as ghow ee yn obbyr ayns laue feer chiarailagh as ish shuilgey un pheesh hoshiaght as eisht y pheesh elley, as ny keayrtyn v’ee gaase ny smoo toallee, as ny keayrtyn ny s’girrey, gys v’eh er jeet lhee dy gholl erash gys e h-yrjid cliaghtagh. ",
"       It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.","       V’eh cho foddey neayr’s v’ee er ve red erbee goll rish e mooadys kiart dy row eh gennaghtyn quaagh dy liooar ec y toshiaght; agh haink ee dy ve cliaghtit rish ayns shiartanse dy vinnidyn, as ghow ee toshiaght dy loayrt ree hene, myr dy cliaghtagh,",

CHAPTER VI.,CABDYL 6 ,
Pig and Pepper,Muc as Pibbyr ,
"       For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood — (she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish) — and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.","       Rish minnid ny ghaa v’ee ny shassoo jeeaghyn er y thie, as ish smooinaghtyn c’red dy yannoo, tra, dy doaltattym, roie guilley drid va coamrit ayns eaddagh shirveishagh magh ass y cheyll - (v'ee contey eh dy ve ny ghuilley drid er y fa dy row eh coamrit myr shen: er nonney, veih'n eddin echey ny lomarcan, veagh ee er ghra eeast rish) - as chrank eh dy sheeanagh er y dorrys lesh ny h-uddaneyn echey.",
"It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. ","V'eh er ny 'osley ec guilley drid elley ayns eaddagh shirveishagh, lesh eddin cruinn, as sooillyn mooarey goll rish rannag; as hug Ealish my ner dy row folt poodyrit ec y daa ghuilley drid, folt casagagh va ooilley harrish nyn ging. ",
"She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.","V’ee feer pheeikearagh as by vie lhee dy mooar feddyn magh c'red va goll er, as ren ee snaue magh ass y cheyll, beggan, dy eaishtagh. ",
"       The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess.","       Ghow y Guilley Drid Eeastee toshiaght as eshyn goaill magh screeuyn mooar va er ve fo’n roih echey. Va’n screeuyn bunnys cho mooar as eshyn, as hug eh eh da’n fer elley, as dooyrt eh dy trome-chooishagh, “Son y Vendiuic.",
An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.” ,Cuirrey veih’n Venrein dy chloie croquet.” ,
"The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little,","Va shoh grait reesht ec y Ghuilley Drid Rannag, dy trome-chooishagh neesht, agh va oardagh ny focklyn caghlaait beggan,",
“From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”,“Veih’n Venrein. Cuirrey da’n Vendiuic dy chloie croquet.” ,
"       Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.","       Eisht chroym y jees jeu sheese dy h-injil, as haink ny casagyn oc dy ve kianlt ry cheilley. ",
"       Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.","       Hug shoh er Ealish garaghtee wheesh as dy beign jee roie erash sy cheyll er aggle dy gluinnagh ad ee; as, tra speeik ee magh lurg shoh, va’n Guilley Drid Eeastee ersooyl, as va’n fer elley ny hoie er y thalloo faggys da’n dorrys, as eshyn blakey dy bolvaneagh seose sy speyr. ",
"       Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.",       Hie Ealish dy faitagh gys y dorrys as chrank ee er. ,
"“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.” ","“Cha neeu eh ve crankal myr shen,” dooyrt y Guilley Drid, “as ta shen er daa oyr.

"       And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within — a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.","       As son shickyrys v’ad feiyral erskyn insh cheu-sthie — gullal as streighyraght gyn scuirr, as polt mooar nish as reesht, myr dy beagh jyst ny coirrey veg er ny vrishey ayns peeshyn. ",
"        “Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”","        “Kyndagh rish shen, my sailliu,” dooyrt Ealish, “cre'n aght foddym cosney stiagh?” ",
"        “There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without attending to her, “if we had the door between us.","        “Foddee dy beagh eh keeallagh dy beagh uss crankal,” ren y Guilley Drid goll er, gyn cur geill jee, “dy beagh y dorrys eddyr ain. ",
"For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.”","Myr sampleyr, dy beagh uss cheu-sthie, oddagh oo crankal, as oddins lhiggey stiagh oo, ta fys ayd.”",
"He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.","V’eh jeeaghyn seose sy speyr ooilley yn traa v'eh loayrt, as heill Ealish dy row shoh neu- ghoiagh, son shickyrys.",
"“But perhaps he can’t help it,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions. —How am I to get in?” she repeated, aloud.","“Agh foddee nagh vel niart echey er,” dooyrt ee ree hene; “ta e hooillyn feer, feer faggys da baare e ching.

"        “I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow — ”","        “Soieym ayns shoh,” dimraa yn Guilley Drid, “gys laa ny vairagh —”",
"       At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.","       Ec y vinnid shoh, va dorrys y thie foshlit, as detlee moggaid mooar magh, dy jeeragh lesh kione y Ghuilley Drid: screeb eh yn ’troin echey, as v’eh brisht ayns peeshyn noi nane jeh ny biljyn ny chooyl.

"“— or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened.","“— er nonney y laa nuyr, foddee,” hie y Guilley Drid er lesh y choraa cheddin, myr nagh row veg er daghyrt. ",
"        “How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.","        “Cre’n aght bee’m cosney stiagh?” vrie Ealish reesht, ny stroshey. ",
"        “Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first question, you know.”","        “Bee uss cosney stiagh er chor erbee?” dooyrt y Guilley Drid. “Shen y chied feysht, ta fys ayd.” ",
"       It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue. It’s enough to drive one crazy!”","       V’eh kiart, gyn ourys: agh cha by vie lesh Ealish dy ve inshit. “Dy firrinagh, t’eh agglagh,” ren Ealish tallagh ree hene, “yn aght ta gagh cretoor jannoo arganys.

"       The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for days and days.”","       V'eh jeeaghyn dy row y Guilley Drid coontey shoh dy ve ny chaa mie dy ghra yn un red reesht, lesh caghlaayn beggey. “Soieym ayns shoh,” dooyrt eh, “nish as reesht, son laghyn as laghyn.” ",
        “But what am I to do?” said Alice.,        “Agh cre veem's hene jannoo?” dooyrt Ealish. ,
"        “Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.","        “Red erbee sailt,” dooyrt y Guilley Drid, as ghow eh toshiaght dy ’eddanagh. ",
"        “Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.","        “Ogh, cha nel eh feeu dy loayrt rishyn,” dooyrt Ealish dy debejagh: “t'eh slane ommidjagh!” As doshil ee y dorrys as hie ish stiagh. ",
"       The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.","       Haink ee dy jeeragh stiagh ayns shamyr-aarlee vooar, va lane dy yaagh veih’n derrey kione gys y jeh elley: va’n Vendiuic ny soie er stoyl tree chassagh sy vean as ish boandyrys oikan: va’n aarlider croymmey harrish yn aile, as eh mestey coirrey vooar va jeeaghyn dy ve lane dy awree. ",
"        “There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing.","        “Son shickyrys ta rouyr pibbyr syn awree shen!” dooyrt Ealish ree hene, chammah as oddagh ee as ish streighyraght. ",
"       There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause.

"The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.","Yn ynrican daa chretoor sy chamyr-aarlee nagh ren streighyraght, v’ad shen yn aarlider as kayt mooar va ny lhie ec y chiollagh as gyrnal veih un chleaysh gys y fer elley. ",
"        “Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why your cat grins like that?”","        “Jean shiu ginsh dou, my sailliu,” dooyrt Ealish, beggan faitagh, er y fa nagh row ee lane shickyr row eh cooyrtoil dy loayrt hoshiaght, “cre'n fa ta’n kayt eu gyrnal myr shen?” ",

"       She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—","       Dooyrt ee y fockle s’jerree lesh wheesh raghlid doaltattym as dy ren Ealish sprettal; agh ayns grig elley hoig ee dy row ee loayrt rish yn oikan as cha nee reeish, as, myr shen, haink ee dy ve dunnal, as hie ish er reesht:- ",
"“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats could grin.”","“Cha row fys aym dy row kiyt-Cheshire kinjagh gyrnal; dy jarroo, cha row fys aym dy noddagh kiyt gyrnal.” ",
"        “They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”","        “Foddee ad ooilley gyrnal,” dooyrt y Vendiuic: “as shen ny ta'n chooid smoo jeu jannoo.” ",
"        “I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.","        “Cha nel fys aym er kiyt erbee ta jannoo shen,” dooyrt Ealish feer chooyrtoil, as ish bwooiagh dy liooar dy ghoaill ayrn ayns coloayrtys. ",

"       Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.","       Cha bynney lesh Ealish yn aght va shoh grait, as heill ee dy bare jee loayrt mychione cooish ennagh elley.",
"While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby — the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.","Choud’s v’ee prowal smooinaghtyn er cooish ennagh, ghow yn aarlider y choirrey dy awree jeh'n aile, as dy chelleeragh ghow ee toshiaght dy cheau dy chooilley red v'ee abyl roshtyn lesh y Vendiuic as yn oikan — haink ny yiarnyn-ailey hoshiaght; eisht haink frass dy phannaghyn, moggaidyn as jystyn.",
"The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.","Cha dug y Vendiuic geill erbee daue, eer tra v'ee bwoaillit oc; as va'n oikan gullyrnee wheesh hannah as dy row eh slane neu-yantagh dy ghra row ny bwoaillaghyn lhottey eh ny dyn. ",
"        “Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.","        “Ogh, gow kiarail, ta mee guee ort!” dyllee Ealish, as ish lheim neese sheese lesh aggle vooar. “Ogh, shen e ’troin ennoil ersooyl!”, myr va panney feer vooar getlagh shaghey faggys jee, as bunnys cur lesh ee. ",
"        “If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”","        “Dy beagh dy chooilley pheiagh cur geill da ny cooishyn oc hene,” ren y Vendiuic gyrnal dy garroo, “ragh y seihll mygeayrt foddey ny s’tappee na t’eh goll.” ",

“Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis —”,"“Smooinee er yn obbyr veagh jeant echey lesh y laa as yn oie! Ta’n seihll chyndaa mygeayrt er yn essyl echey ayns kiare oor as feed, as giarrey y traa —”",
"        “Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”","        “Loayrt mychione giarrey, giar jeh e kione!” ",
"       Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: ","       Hug Ealish e sooillyn imneagh dy liooar er yn aarlider, jeeaghyn row ee son cur geill da'n faaue; agh va’n aarlider mestey yn awree dy tarroogh, as v’eh jeeaghyn nagh row ee geaishtagh, myr shen hie ish er reesht: ",

"And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line:","As er shen, ghow ee toshiaght dy voandyrys yn oikan reesht, as ish goaill sorch dy arrane-cadlee, as craa eh dy niartal ec y jerrey jeh gagh linney:—",

(In which the cook and the baby joined):,(yn aarlider as yn oikan ry cheilley): —,
“Wow! wow! wow!”,“Wow! wow! wow!” ,
"     While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:—","     Choud’s va’n Vendiuic goaill y nah ronney jeh’n arrane, v’ee kinjagh ceau yn oikan dy raghtal neese sheese, as va'n red beg boght gullyrnee wheesh as dy row eh doillee da Ealish clashtyn ny goan:- ",

"      “Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.","      “Shoh eh! Foddee uss eh y voandyrys son tammylt, my t'ou laccal!” dooyrt y Vendiuic rish Ealish, as ee ceau yn oikan lhee myr v’ee loayrt. ",

"“I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. ","“Shegin dou goll as jannoo aarloo dy chloie croquet marish y Venrein,” as hiyree ish magh ass y chamyr. ",
"The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.","Cheau yn aarlider frynepan lhee myr v’ee goll magh, as v'ee bunnys bwoaillit echey. ",
"     Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like a star-fish,” thought Alice.

"The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.","Va’n red beg boght stronnaghey goll rish greie-bree tra hayr ee eh, as v’eh kinjagh doobley eh hene as eisht jeeraghey eh hene reesht.

"     As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.","     Cho leah’s hooar ee magh yn aght kiart dy voandyrys eh (va shen dy chassey eh ayns sorch dy chront as eisht cummal greim niartal er e chleaysh yesh dyn y chur caa da feaysley eh hene), ren ee cur eh lhee magh fo’n speyr.

"“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.”","“Ny groaish,” dooyrt Ealish, “cha nel shen ny aght cooie dy hoilshaghey magh dty smooinaghtyn.” ",

"There could be no doubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all.

"     Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm.

"This time there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.","Y keayrt shoh, cha dod ee ve aggairagh: she muc v'ayn son shickyrys, as dennee ish dy beagh eh ommidjagh erskyn towse dy derragh ee lhee eh ny sodjey. ",

A Mad Tea-Party,Giense-Tey Keoi ,
"     There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.","     Va boayrd currit magh fo billey beeal rish y thie, as va’n Mwaagh Vart as yn Eddeyder goaill tey ayns shen: va Lugh Vagheragh ny soie eddyr oc as ee ny cadley dy dowin, as va'n jees elley gymmydey ee myr clooishag, nyn uiljyn nyn lhie urree, as ad taggloo harrish e kione.

     Alice was silent.,     Va Ealish ny tost. ,
"     The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: ","     Va’n Lugh Vagheragh er ghooney e sooillyn ec y traa shoh, as va cadley cheet urree; agh, lurg jee ve mingit ec yn Eddeyder, ghooisht ee reesht lesh screeagh beg, as hie ee er: ",

"     This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.","     Va’n lunaght shoh ny smoo na va Ealish abyl jannoo lesh: dirree ish ny shassoo as feoh mooar urree as ersooyl lhee: huitt y Lugh Vagheragh ny cadley dy chelleeragh, as cha dug ny fir elley geill erbee dy row ee ersooyl, ga dy yeeagh ee erash keayrt ny ghaa, as ee lieh-hreishteil dy nyllagh ad lurg eck: y keayrt s’jerree honnick ee ad, v'ad shirrey cur y Lugh Vagheragh stiagh sy phash-hey. ",

CHAPTER VIII.,CABDYL 8 ,
The Queen’s Croquet-Ground,Faaie-Croquet y Venrein ,
"     A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.

"Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five!

"     Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.","     Cheau Shiaght sheese e skeaban, as v’eh kiart er ngoaill toshiaght “Dy jarroo, cre cho neuchairagh —” tra haghyr eh dy yeeagh eh er Ealish as ish ny shassoo jeeaghyn orroo, as ren eh lhiettallys ersyn hene dy doaltattym: yeeagh ny fir elley mygeayrt neesht, as ren ad ooilley croymmey sheese dy h-injil. ",

"     Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.","     Cha dooyrt Queig as Shiaght veg, agh yeeagh ad er Jees.",
"Two began in a low voice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.","Ghow Jees toshiaght, ayns coraa injil, “Cammah, ta’n bun jeh, Inneen, lhisagh eh shoh ve ny villey-rose jiarg, as, dy marranagh, hug shin stiagh fer bane; as, dy voghe y Venrein magh, veagh ooilley nyn ging giarrit jin, ta fys ayd.

"At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces.

"There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.","Va ram kesmadyn coshey ry chlashtyn, as yeeagh Ealish mygeayrt dy jeean dy 'akin y Venrein. ",
"     First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; ","     Hoshiaght, haink jeih sidooryn gymmyrkey spaagyn: va'n cummey oc shoh goll rish ny tree gareyderyn, far-cherrinagh as rea as ny laueyn as cassyn oc ec ny corneilyn; eisht, haink ny jeih cooyrteyryn; ",

"After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.

"Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: ","Lurg shen haink ny goaldee, Reeaghyn as Mraane-Rein son y chooid smoo, as hug Ealish enney er y Chonning Vane ny mast’oc: ",

"     Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” ","     Va Ealish beggan ouryssagh Ihisagh ee lhie sheese er e h-eddin goll rish ny tree gareyderyn, agh cha dod ee cooinaghtyn dy geayll rieau reill myr shen ec cosheeaghtyn; “as aghterbee, cre’n feeuid veagh ec cosheeaght,” smooinee Ealish, “dy beagh ooilley y sleih eginit lhie sheese er nyn eddinyn, as cha noddagh ad fakin veg?” ",
"So she stood still where she was, and waited.","Myr shen, hass ee raad v’ee, as duirree ish. ",

"She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.","Dooyrt ee shen rish Fieaumanagh ny Creeaghyn, nagh ren agh croymmey sheese as mongey myr freggyrt. ",

"      “And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.","      “As quoi ad shoh?” dooyrt y Venrein, as ish cowraghey magh ny tree gareyderyn va nyn lhie mygeayrt y mysh y villey-rose; t'ou toiggal, er y fa dy row ad nyn lhie er nyn eddinyn, as va'n soylley er ny dreeymyn oc yn un red as v'er ny fir elley, cha dod y Venrein fakin nee gareyderyn, ny sidooryn, ny cooyrteyryn, ny troor jeh ny paitchyn eck hene v’ayn. ",

"      “Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.

"     Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.","     Heill Ealish nagh row ee rieau er nakin faaie-croquet cho quaagh sy vea eck: va oirragyn as creaghyn ass towse ayn: she arkanyn-sonney bio va ny bluckanyn-croquet, as she lossyraneyn bio va ny thornaneyn, as beign da ny sidooryn ad hene y ghoobley as shassoo er nyn laueyn as cassyn, dy yannoo ny h-aaeghyn. ",
"     The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: ","     Hoshiaght, y chied doilleeid ec Ealish, va shen cur smaght er y lossyrane eck: haink eh lhee cur e chorp, aashagh dy liooar, fo'n roih eck, as e lurgaghyn croghey sheese, agh, dy cliaghtagh, kiart myr va'n mwannal echey er ny yeeraghey eck as v'ee er chee bwoalley yn arkan sonney lesh e chione, veagh eh cassey eh hene mygeayrt as jeeaghyn seose ayns e h-eddin er aght cho boirit as nagh dod ee jannoo fegooish tuittym er garaghtee; as tra veagh e chione currit sheese eck reesht, as veagh ee er chee goaill toshiaght reesht, veagh ee brasnit dy mooar dy 'eddyn magh dy beagh yn arkan sonney neu-rowlit as er chee snaue ersooyl: ",
"besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.","as, ny sodjey na shoh, dy cliaghtagh veagh oirrag ny creagh raad erbee veagh ee laccal cur yn arkan sonney huggey, as, myr veagh ny sidooryn dooblit kinjagh girree seose as shooyl gys buill elley er y faaie, hoig Ealish feer tappee dy nee gamman feer doillee v’ayn dy jarroo. ",
"     The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.","     Va ny cloiederyn ooilley cloie ec yn un cheayrt, gyn fuirraghtyn rish shayllyn, as ad tuittym magh car y traa, as jannoo caggey son ny h-arkanyn sonney; ayns traa feer gherrid, va eulys agglagh er y Venrein, va stampey mygeayrt as gyllagh magh “Ersooyl lesh e chione!"" ny ""Ersooyl lesh e kione!"" red goll rish un cheayrt gagh minnid. ",
"     Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would become of me?

"     She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.”","     V'ee shirrey aght ennagh dy scapail, as sheiltyn beagh ee abyl gimmeeaght magh ass gyn ve fakinit, tra hug ee my ner red ennagh quaagh syn aer: v’eh cur urree ve boirit hoshiaght, agh erreish jee v’er yeeaghyn er son minnid ny ghaa, honnick ee dy nee gyrn v'ayn, as dooyrt ee ree hene “She yn Kayt-Cheshire t’ayn: nish bee peiagh ennagh aym dy haggloo rish.”",

"In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.","Ayns minnid elley, va'n slane chione er jeet rish, as eisht hug Ealish sheese e lossyrane, as ghow ee toshiaght dy insh mychione y gamman as ish feer wooiagh dy row peiagh ayn dy eaishtagh ree.",

"      “Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely —” Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, “— likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”","      “Cha mie lhiam ee,” dooyrt Ealish: “t’ee feer — “Kiart ec y traa shen, hug ee my ner dy row y Venrein feer faggys jee, cooyl eck as ish geaishtagh: myr shen, hie ee er “ — liklee dy chosney y varriaght, as cha nel eh feeu dy chur kione er y ghamman.” ",

"     Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion.","     Heill Ealish dy beagh eh chammah jee goll erash as fakin cre’n aght va’n gamman goll er, er y fa dy geayll ee coraa y Venrein sy foddid as ish screeaghey dy h-eulyssagh.",
"She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not.

So she went in search of her hedgehog.,"Myr shen, hie ee dy hirrey lurg e h-arkan sonney. ",
"     The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: ","     Va’n arkan sonney caggey rish arkan sonney elley, as va Ealish coontey shoh dy ve ny chaa feer vie dy chroquetal nane jeu marish y fer elley: ",
"the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.","yn ynrican doilleeid, va shen dy row y lossyrane eck ersooyl gys y cheu elley jeh’n gharey, raad oddagh Ealish fakin eh as eh prowal er aght moal dy etlagh seose ayns billey. ",
"     By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t matter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.” ","     Tra v’ee er dayrtyn y lossyrane as er chur lhee eh erash, va'n caggey harrish, as va'n daa arkan sonney ass shilley: “agh s'cummey shen,” smooinee Ealish, “er y fa dy vel ooilley ny aaeghyn ersooyl veih’n cheu shoh jeh'n faaie.” ",
"     So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.","     Myr shen, hug ee eh fo'n aghlish eck er aght nagh dod eh scapail reesht, as hie ee erash dy ghoaill cowag veg elley marish e carrey. ",
"     When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.","     Tra hie ee erash gys y Chayt-Cheshire, va yindys urree tra hooar ee magh dy row chionnal mooar mygeayrt y mysh: va arganys goll er eddyr y varrooder, y Ree, as y Venrein, va ooilley taggloo ec yn un cheayrt, choud's va ny fir elley nyn dost dy bollagh as jeeaghyn feer vee-gherjoilagh. ",
"The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.","     Cho leah’s haink Ealish ree, ren y troor aghin jee y feysht y ’eaysley, as docklee ad nyn arganyssyn ree reesht, agh, er yn oyr dy loayr ad ooilley ec yn un cheayrt, v'eh feer doillee dy hoiggal dy kiart c’red v’ad gra. ",
,,
"     The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.","     Arganys y varrooder, va shen nagh noddagh oo giarrey kione veih corp mannagh row corp ayn dy yiarrey eh veih: nagh row rieau er jannoo y lheid roie, as nagh row eh kiarail goaill toshiaght ec yn eash echeysyn. ",

"     The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round.

(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.),(She y raa s’jerree shoh hug er y clane cheshaght jeeaghyn cho fastagh as imneagh.),
Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess: you’d better ask her about it.”,Cha dod Ealish smooinaght er red erbee elley dy ghra agh “S’lesh y Vendiuic eh: bare diu briaght jeeish my e chione.”,

And the executioner went off like an arrow.,As ersooyl lesh y varrooder goll rish side. ,
"     The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.","     Ghow kione y Chayt toshiaght dy 'ioghey ersooyl cho leah’s v’eh ersooyl, as, liorish y traa v’eh er jeet erash marish y Vendiuic, v’eh er skellal roish dy bollagh: myr shen, roie y Ree as y marrooder noon as noal dy keoi, dy hirrey, choud’s va’n chooid elley jeh'n çheshaght goll erash gys y gamman. ",

"      “You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!” said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s, and they walked off together.","      “Cha nod oo toiggal cre cho bwooiagh as ta mee dy ’akin oo reesht, my henn charrey veen!” dooyrt y Vendiuic, myr v’ee cur e laue dy graihagh ayns uillin Ealish, as hooill ad ersooyl ry cheilley. ",
"     Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.","     Va Ealish feer wooiagh dy row ee ayns gien cho mie, as smooinee ish ree hene foddee dy nee yn pibbyr ny lomarcan va cur urree ve cho oaldey tra haink ad nyn guaiyl sy chamyr-aarlee. ",

"Soup does very well without — Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour — and camomile that makes them bitter — and — and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.","Ta awree jannoo feer vie n'egooish - Foddee she pibbyr ta kinjagh cur er sleih ve eulyssagh,” hie ee er, as ish jeant feer wooiagh dy row ee er ngeddyn sorch noa dy reill, “as feeyn geayr ta cur orroo ve geayr — as fennel ny moddee ta cur orroo ve sharroo — as — as shugyr oarn ta cur er paitchyn ve soccaragh.

And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as she spoke.,As hraast ee ee hene ny sniessey da lhiattee Ealish myr v’ee loayrt. ,
"     Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.","     Cha by vie lesh Ealish ve cho faggys jee: hoshiaght, er y fa dy row y Vendiuic feer ghraney; as y nah red, er y fa dy row ee dy jeeragh yn yrjid kiart dy lhiggey da'n smeg eck lhie er geaylin Ealish, as she smeg vee-gherjoilagh, virragh v'ayn.

"     “And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.”","     “As shen bink ny bingey,” smooinee Ealish; “as y daa chretoor yeig shen,” (v’ee eginit gra “cretoor”, t’ou toiggal, er y fa dy row paart jeu nyn meiyn as paart nyn ushagyn,) “ta mee sheiltyn dy nee ny fir bingagh ad shen.”",
"She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. ","Dooyrt ee y raa s'jerree daa ny tree keayrtyn ree hene, er y fa dy row ee goaill moyrn dy liooar ass: er y fa dy heill ee, as v'ee kiart, nagh row agh shiartanse feer veg dy inneenyn aegey jeh'n eash eck toiggal y bun jeh noadyr.

"However, “jury-men” would have done just as well.","Aghterbee, veagh ""Fir ny bingey"" mie dy liooar neesht. ",
"    The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”","    Va’n daa chretoor yeig sy ving ooilley screeu feer tarroogh er sclateyn.

"“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.","     “Cretooryn bolvaneagh!” dooyrt Ealish ayns coraa niartal as corree; agh scuirr ee ee hene dy tappee, er y hon dy dyllee y Chonning Vane magh “Tostid sy chooyrt!”, as hug y Ree mysh e speckleyryn as ghow eh toshiaght dy yeeaghyn mygeayrt dy h- imneagh dy 'eddyn magh quoi va loayrt. ",
"Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.","Oddagh Ealish fakin, kiart cho mie as dy beagh ee jeeaghyn harrish ny geayltyn oc, dy row ooilley ny fir bingagh screeu sheese “Cretooryn bolvaneagh!” er nyn sclateyn, as v'ee abyl fakin nagh row fys ec nane jeu er yn aght kiart dy screeu ""bolvaneagh"" as dy beign dou shirrey cooney veih'n naboo echey.

"She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.","Va shen jeant cho tappee eck as nagh dod y fer bingagh boght (she Illiam, y Jiolgan Leaghyr, v'ayn) toiggal cre haink er; myr shen, erreish da v'er hirrey ee dy chooilley voayl, v'eh eginit screeu lesh un vair son y chooid elley jeh'n laa; as va shoh dyn ymmyd, er y fa nagh row cowrey faagit er y sclate. ",

"      “Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”","     “Cur fys er y chied feanishagh,” dooyrt y Ree; as heid y Chonning Vane tree keayrtyn er y chayrn, as dyllee eh magh “Y chied feanishagh!”",

"     The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I think it was,” he said.","     Yeeagh yn Eddeyder er y Waagh Vart, va er neiyrt er stiagh sy chamyr-cooyrtey as eh uillin er uillin lesh y Lugh Vagheragh. “Y chiarroo laa jeig jeh Mee Vart, er lhiam.” dooyrt eh. ",

"      “Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.","      “Yn cheyoo laa jeig,” dooyrt y Lugh Vagheragh. ",
"      “Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.","      “Screeu-jee shen sheese,” dooyrt y Ree rish y ving; as screeu y ving sheese dy jeean ooilley ny tree dateyn er ny sclateyn oc, as eisht ren ad cur ad ry cheilley as dobbree ad magh yn ansoor ayns skilleeyn as pingyn. ",

"     Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.","     Er shoh, hug y Venrein urree e speckleyryn, as ghow ee toshiaght dy vlakey feer jeean er yn Eddeyder, ren çheet dy ve bane-eddinagh as foostyragh. ",

"Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her.","Jeeragh ec y thootch shoh, va Ealish gennaghtyn feer whaagh, ren boirey urree dy mooar gys hoig ee cre va taghyrt: v’ee goaill toshiaght dy aase mooar reesht, as smooinee ee hoshiaght dy drog- gagh ee urree as faagail y chooyrt; agh lurg smooinaght, reih ish dy hannaghtyn raad v'ee cho foddey as va reamys ayn jee. ",

"      “Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, ","     “Ayns shoh!” dyllee Ealish magh as ish jarrood dy bollagh sy chorvaal cre cho mooar as v’ee er naase er y gherrit, as lheim ee seose as driss cho mooar urree as dy lhiegg ee bink ny bingey lesh chemmal e rhumbyl as va ooilley fir ny bingey ceaut er king y chionnal heese.

"— the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy","— veagh clabberey ny cappanyn caghlaa gys claggyraght ny cluig keyrragh, as veagh yllaghyn ard y Venrein caghlaa gys coraa y vochilley ",
"— and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard","— as veagh streighyraght yn oikan, screeagh y Ghryphon, as ooilley ny sheeanyn quaagh elley, caghlaa (va fys eck) gys corvaal mestit y voayl eirinagh",
— while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.,— choud’s veagh eamagh yn ollee sy foddid goaill yn ynnyd jeh soghyn sharroo y Far-Ligganagh Marrey. ,
"     Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.","     Sy jerrey, heill ee ree hene yn aght veagh y chuyr veg shoh eck cheet dy ve, sy traa ry heet, ny ben aasit ish hene; as yn aght veagh ee freayll, car ny bleeantyn ooilliu, y cree glen as graihagh jeh e lambaanid; as yn aght veagh ee chymsaghey mygeayrt y mooee paitchyn beggey elley, as cur er ny sooillyn ocsyn dy ve gial as jeean lesh skeealyn quaagh dy liooar, foddee lesh ashlish cheer ny Yindyssyn veih foddey er dy henney; as yn aght veagh co-ennaghtyn eck lesh ooilley nyn drimshaghyn neu-ghoillee, as feddyn taitnys ayns ooilley yn boggey neu-ghoillee oc, as cooinaghtyn eck er y lambaanid eck hene as ny laghyn souree maynrey. ",
