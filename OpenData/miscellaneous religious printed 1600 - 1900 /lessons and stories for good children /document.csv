"[32] [The following PRAYERS are drawn up for your use, both in English and Maks, that you may commit them to memory, in either of those languages. The first Prayers are for the younger Scholars, and the two last for such of you as are preparing for CONFIRMATION. These were written by the excellent Bishop WILSON, now with GOD and his ANGELS; where you also will hereafter be, if you be “folowers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.”]",,
