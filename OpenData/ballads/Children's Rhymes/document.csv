Manx,English,Notes
,Counting a baby’s toes — Analagous to the English “This little pig went to Market”,
Dooyrt eh shoh “Ta mee goll dy gheid”,This one said “I am going to steal”,
      “    “     “      “C’raad”,      “    “     “      “Where?”,
      “    “     “      “Ayns soalt my yishig”,      “    “     “      “In my father’s barn”,
      “    “     “      “Higgyms mayrt”,      “    “     “      “I will come with thee”,

,A variant of Moore’r rhyme on p216 of Manx Ballads,

Geiyrt er ny mraane ny oanraghyn jiargey,Following the women with red petticoats,
Jump! Jump! Harrish y phoyll,Jump! Jump! Over the pool,
Geiyrt er ny mraane ny oanraghyn tuill’.,Following the women with petticoats in holes,
,The following version of the Hop-tu-naa is very like the more perfect copy of Dr Clague’s. However I give it for what it is worth:,
Hop-tu-naa Noght ta Houney [? oie houney],Hop-tu-naa Tonight is Hollantide [? eve],
  “     “    “    Mairaigh Laa Souney,  “     “    “    Tomorrow is Hollantide day,
  “     “    “    Kellagh as kiark,  “     “    “    Cock & hen,
  “     “    “    Ceau mee ’sy phot,  “     “    “    I cast in the pot,
  “     “    “    Y pot mie broit,  “     “    “    The good pot of broth,
  “     “    “    Scoaldey ny hengey,  “     “    “    Scoalding my tongue,
  “     “    “    Roie mee rish chibbyr,  “     “    “    I ran to the well,
  “     “    “    Cre honnick oo shen?,  “     “    “    What saw you there?,
  “     “    “    Kayt mooar gyrnal,  “     “    “    A great cat snarling.,
  “     “    “    Roie mee gys Albin,  “     “    “    I ran to Scotland,
  “     “    “    Cre honnick oo ayns shen?,  “     “    “    What saw you there?,
  “     “    “    Ben giarey caashey,  “     “    “    A woman cutting cheese,
  “     “    “    Ghiare ee y vair eck,  “     “    “    She cut her finger,
  “     “    “    Lap ee ayns sheidey,  “     “    “    She lapped it in silk[3],[3] lapped] ‘wrapped’ (Anglo-Manx dialect).
  “     “    “    Trogg ee lesh freeney[2]     ,  “     “    “    She lifted [it] with a pin [i.e. fastened it],"[2] trogg ee] this could possibly be [trogg ee] ‘she will lift’, but the more common future / imperative form of the verb is  [troggee]. Sugggested translation; [Lap ee ayns sheidey, Troggee lesh freeney] ‘Wrap it in silk, Lift it with a pin’."
