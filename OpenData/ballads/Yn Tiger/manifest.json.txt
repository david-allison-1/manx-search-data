Another version of the ballad, with an additional five verses and other alterations appears in \u0027Manx Society XXI; Mona Miscellany; Ballads and Songs.\u0027 Col. \u0026 Ed. William Harrrison. Manx Society. Douglas. 1873, under the title \u0027Marrinys y Tiger, Liorish John Moore\u0027, with an accompanying translation by Mr. John Quirk, Carn-ny-Greie, entitled \u0027The Voyage of the Tiger\u0027. Harrison\u0027s version also appears in \u0027Manx Ballads and Songs\u0027 Ed. A. W. Moore. G \u0026 R Johnson. 1896, accompanied by a more literal translation. This manuscript version from papers held within Lioar Chlugaaish appears to be the older of the two, using loanwords such as \u0027cruize\u0027, \u0027station\u0027, \u0027pumpal\u0027, \u0027riggal\u0027 and \u0027fittal magh\u0027 which do not appear in the printed versions. Lioar Chlugaaish is undated, but is assumed to date from around 1850.",
