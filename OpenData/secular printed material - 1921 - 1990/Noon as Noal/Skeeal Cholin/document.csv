"Va daa phaitchey elley ec Joe, Juan, mysh yn eash cheddin as my huyr, as Norman, agh v’eshyn foddey ny shinney as v’eh ’sy Lhuingys Ghoaldagh myr shiaulteyr.","Joe had two other children, Juan, about the same age as my sister, and Norman, but he was much older and he was in the British Navy as a sailor.",
"Cha row chellveeish erbee ayn ayns ny laghyn shen as cha dug shin monney geill da’n radio, myr shen cheau shin y fastyr ginsh skeealyn.",There wasn’t any television in those days and we didin’t pay much heed to the radiom so we spent time the evening telling stories.,
Va Joe rieau ayns boirey ennagh as va drogh-haghyrtyn geiyrt er as fuirraghtyn ersyn gagh laa. ,Joe was always in some trouble and disasters were following him and waiting for him every day.,
Keayrt dy row haink eh stiagh syn “Ollay” as eshyn fliugh veih mullagh e ching dys boyn e choshey.,"Once, he came into the “Swan” and he was wet from the top of his head to the heel of his foot.",
Va oie vraew dy jarroo ayn as rollageyn yn aer soilshean gyn bodjal erbee ry-akin.,It was a fine night indeed with the stars in the sky shining without a cloud at all to be seen.,

"“Haink frass doaltattym orrym,” dreggyr Joe.","“A shower suddenly came upon me,” (“I got caught in a shower”) Joe answered.",
Haink sleih elley stiagh ny s’anmey as va dagh ooilley ’er jeu slane chirrym.,Other people came in later and every one of them was completely dry.,
"Cha s’ayms haink frass er Joe myr dooyrt eh, agh va daa awin ayn eddyr e hie as yn “Ollay” as mannagh duitt Joe ayns ’nane jeu v’eh ny ghooinney ynrican huitt frass erbee er yn oie shen.","I don’t know if Joe got caught in a shower as he said, but there were two rivers between his house and the “Swan” and if Joe didn’t fall in one of them he was the only man caught in any shower that night.",
"Cha lhisagh shiu goaill yindys dy jagh eh ny hrooid awin er e raad gys y thie lhionney, by gummey leshyn ve fliugh dy jinnagh eh cosney red ennagh.","You shouldn’t be surprised that he went through a river on his way to the alehouse, being wet didn’t matter to him if he would get something.",

Va boayl ennagh ayn faggys da’n thie echey enmyssit “Lhag y Chruink Yiarg” as laa dy row va Norman shooyl er y raad ayns shen. ,There was somewhere near to his house called “The Hollow of the Red Hill” and one day Norman was walking on the highway there.,

Cha row fys ec Joe dy row Norman ersooyl derrey rosh eh thie.,Joe didn’t know that Norman was gone until he arrived home.,
"Va’n cabbyl-yiarn shoh, feer henn as sollagh, v’eh ny Triumph 650 er lhiams.","This motorbike was very old and dirty, it was a Triumph 650, I think.",
Ny keayrtyn va cheu-charr (sidecar) lhiantyn huggey. ,Sometimes there was a sidecar attached to it.,

Cha noddym pene cooinaghtyn ersyn bunnys fegooish y bayrn er e chione!,I can’t myself remember him almost without the cap on his head!,
"Ny s’anmey, cheau eh edd runt, er lheh er y Doonaght, as er y laa ta mee gimraa, hie eh dys bayr coon garroo heose er y chronk.","Later, he wore a bowler hat, especially on the Sabbath, and on the day I am mentioning, he went to a narrow road up on the hill. ",

"Ghoolish y charrey, Er hoh dhyt fy-yerrey hoal ny cooinaghtyn ayms jeh Caesar Cashin.  ","Dear Doolish, here for you at long last are my memories of Caesar Cashin.",
S’feer eh dy jarroo dy row Gaelg ry-ynsaghey ayns ny brastyllyn va goll er cummal tra va mee aeg ayns Purt ny Hinshey.,How true is is indeed that there was Manx to be learnt in the classes that were being held when I was young in Peel.,
By chliaghtey ain son y chooid smoo lhaih ass y Lioar Chasherick agh va caa ain dy chlashtyn rish blass Caesar hene.,"We used to mostly read from the Holy Book, but we had an opportunity to hear Caesar’s own accent.",

"Shoh dooyrt eh rhym pene un oie, “Va mee  ronsaghey ayns kishtey ennagh as hooar mee Bible Ghaelgagh, doshil mee ee as haink fys hym nagh dod mee ee y lhaih er chor erbee as ta shen y oyr dy daink mee da’n vrastyl.”","This is what he said to me one night, “I was searching in some box and I found a Manx Bible, I opened it and I realised that I couldn’t read it at all and that is why I came to the class.”",
Son shickyrys cha row eh feer foddey derrey va’n dooinney ooasle lhaih y Ghaelg dy flaaoil!,"For sure, it wasn’t very long until the noble man was reading Manx fluently!",

"Va shoh yn ennym hug eh orrinyn dy chur er, as myr shen, bee fys euish dy row anmys mooar ain ersyn.","This is the name he made us use for him, and so, know that we had great respect for him.",
"Keayrt dy row vrie shin jeh myr shoh, “Kanys t’ou gra ‘Go to the Devil’ ayns Gaelg?”","Once we asked him like this, “How do you say ‘Go to the Devil’ in Manx?”",

"Un cheayrt, tra rosh shin thie Eairy Cuishlin, ren shin shooyl roin er y clyst.","Once, when we reached Eairy Cushlin House, we walked on the coast.",

"Tra va shin shooyl er ash thie va “Kione Doo” shirrey “heise” (a lift) y chur da Caesar tra v'eh drappal harrish cleigh ennagh, agh haink sheeb ass Caesar “Faag mee feagh — ny jean bac orrym.”"," When we were walking back home “Kione Doo” was asking to give a lift to Caesar when he was climbing over some hedge, but a sharp scold came from Caesar “Leave me be — don’t get in my way.”",
