The usual idiom for ‘on sale’ or ‘available for purchase’ is [ry chreck]. 
Ta Shorus Mac Rurie jannoo obbyr feer vie er skeeallyn Neddy Beg agh bee eh tammylt foast derrey hig adsyn magh.,"George Broderick is doing a very good job on the stories of Neddy Beg, but it will be a while yet until they come out.",

Y NAH HILLEY,THE “SECOND SIGHT”,
"     Laa souree dy row, sy vlein 1906 va’n lhong ghaal “Tabor” er e raad dy valley dys Lerphull, Sostyn ass Poti, Georgia sy Vooir Ghoo, lughtit lesh manganese.","     One Sunmer day, in the year 1906 the steam ship “Tabor” was on its way home to Liverpool, England, from Poti, Georgia in the Black Sea, loaded with manganese.",
"Er y laa ta mee gimraa v’ee mastey ny h-Ellanyn Greagagh, as mish aynjee, my ghuilley-stuirt. Va mee nuy bleeany jeig d’eash ec y traa shen. ","On the day I am mentioning it was amongst the Greek Islands, with me onboard, a steward boy. I was nineteen years old at that time.",

"     Mysh tree cluig lurg munlaa, ta shen dy ghra, lieh oor lurg ’nane er y chlag, ghow mee yn ushtey va ny jystyn er ve strullit ayn as cheau mee eh harrish cheu ny lhuingey, fakin, myr ren mee shen, dy row shin goll shaghey ellan ennagh.","At about three bells after noon, that means, half past one, I took the water the dishes had been rinsed (washed) in and I threw it over the side of the ship, seeing, as I did that, that we were going past some island.",
"Cha lheah as honnick mee dy kiart yn ellan shid, ghow mee yindys, as dooyrt mee rhym pene,","As soon as I saw that island clearly, I was amazed, and I said to myself, ",
“Ta enney aym er yn ellan shid! Ta mee er ve ayns shoh roie!”,“I know that island! I have been here before!”,
"     Agh chelleeragh dreggyr mee rhym pene as dooyrt mee, “Cha row uss rieau ayns shoh roie!","     But I immediately answeredd myself and I said, “You were never here before!",
Cre’n boghtynid ta shoh! Ersooyl lhiat!,What nonsense is this! Away with you!,
Ta shoh yn kied cheayrt t’ou rieau er ve mygeayrt yn cheayn shoh!,This is the first time you have ever been around this sea!,

"“Ta fys aym er shen,” dooyrt mee rhym pene, “Agh son shickyrys ta fys aym dy vel mee er n’akin yn ellan veg shid roie.”","“I know that,” I said to myself, “But ,for sure, I know that I have seen that island before.”",
As yeeagh mee dy jeean er yn ellan reesht. “Gowym loo er shen!”,And I looked earnestly at the island again. “I’ll swear on that!”,
     “Nar[2] jean ommidan jeed hene.” dreggyr mee rhym pene. “Cre’n aght t’ou er n’akin ee as shoh yn kied hraa t’ou er ve fud ny h-ellanyn Greagagh!”,     “Don’t make a fool of yourself.” I answered myself. “How have you seen it — and this is the first time you have been among the Greek islands!”,[2] Nar] [Ny] ‘Don’t’
"     Shen myr v’eh, eisht rish tammylt ny s’odjey. Mish arganey rhym pene, as s’beggan ta ry gheddyn ass y lheid!","     That is how it was, then for a while longer. Me arguing with myself, and how little is to be gained from such a thing!  ",
"     Agh fy yerrey, dy hickyraghey mee hene, dooyrt mee, ","     But at last, to assure myself, I said ",[4] A compass ‘point’ i.e. 11.25 degrees.
"“Kiart dy lioar! Yn ellan shoh, ta ellan elley eck, beggan ny share na creg, ny lhie cooyl yn gheaylin eck, as ta ellan elley ny lhie cheu elley ny lhong, as ta ellan veg eckish neesht, beggan ny smoo[3] na creg neesht, ny lhie ‘point’ jeh’n chione j’ee.","“Right enough! This island, it has another island, hardly more than a rock, lying behind its shoulder (promontory), and there’s another island lying on the other side of the ship, and it has another island too, hardly more than rock too, lying a point[4] off the end of it.","[3] beggan ny smoo] ‘hardly more than’, or, in later Manx ‘a little more than’.
[4] A compass ‘point’ i.e. 11.25 degrees."
As hannah honnick mee ny hellanyn shen myr dy beagh ad kiongoyrt rhym.,And already I saw those islands as if they were before me.,
"     Nish, derrey yn traa shoh, cha row mee er n’akin cheu elley ny lhong, agh, shoh loayrit aym, hie mee roym gys yn cheu elley as yeeagh mee magh, as cur my-ner, shee bannee mee! Va shin er jeet soese rish cass ellan elley.","     Now, until this time, I hadn’t seen the other side of the ship but, this said, I went to the other side and I looked out, and behold, my word! We had come up to the foot of another island.",
"Vong mee er aght fea, as dooyrt mee rhym pene “Cum dty hengey Eoineen, fuirree ort rish tammylt as hee oo red ennagh!”","I smiled in a quiet way, and I said to myself, “Hold you tongue, Johnny, wait a while and you’ll see something!”",
"Aynshen, ny lhie cooyl yn ellan elley, va eer ellan elley ayn, beggan ny smoo na creg myr va mee er ghra dy row!","There, lying behind the other island, there was another island, hardly more than a rock as I had said there was!",
"Eisht roie mee gys cheu elley ny lhing, as son shickyrys, ny lhie ‘point’ jee va’n trass ellan ayn, kiart myr dooyrt mee!","Then I ran to the other side of the ship and for sure, lying a point off it there was the third island, just as I said!",
"     Ymmoddee keayrtyn neayr’s yn traa shen ta ny hellanyn ad shen er ve roish my hooillyn, as ta mee foast goaill yindys kys haink eh lhiam dy akin ad roish my row mee er cheau my hooillyn orroo!","     Many times since that time those islands have been before my eyes, and I am still wondering how I managed to see them before I had cast my eyes upon them!",
"Ta sleih gra, er lheh ny shenn Vanninee as ny Gaeljee ooilley, dy vel reddyn ta ry heet ceau caslyssyn jeu hene roalue.","People say, especially the old Manx and all the Gaels, that things to come (in the future) cast images of themselves beforehand.",
"Ta shin fakin reddyn quaagh ayns ashlishyn ny hoie as ny s’anmey t’ad cheet ayns rieughid, as foddee dy vel red ennagh ayns ny raaghyn shen as y chredjal shen, agh ta mee kiart shickyr nagh vaik mee rieau ny hellanyn shen ayns ashlish erbee rolaue.","We see strange things in night visions (dreams) and later they come in reality, and maybe there is something in those sayings and that belief, but I am quite sure that I never saw those islands in any vision (dream) beforehand.",
Foddee dy vaik mee ad ayns bioys[5] elley? Quoi ec ta fys?,Maybe I saw them in another life?  Who knows?,[5] bioys] ‘life’ as in life force. For ‘life’ as in ‘a lifetime’ [bea] would be expected.
"Cha nel fer erbee ayn dy chur freggyrt da ny keishtyn shen, agh my ta shin er ve ayns shoh roie, cre’n fa nagh vel cooinaghtyn ain jeh?","There is no one who can answer to those questions, but if we have been here before, why don’t we have memories of it?",
"Tra ennagh screeuym skeeal bentyn rish y chooish shen, agh cha nel foast jerrey er yn skeeal t’ayn[6] my aigney dy screeu.","Sometime I will write a story touching on that subject, but there isn’t yet an ending for the present story that I have in mind to write.","[6] ayn] ‘in’. [ayns] is the usual word for ‘in’, but [ayn], although it usually means ‘in it’, is sometimes found for [in] in twentieth century Manx. "

"     Ta cooinaghtyn aym er un shenn dooinney ny Saasilagh v’eh, dooinney slane obbaltagh noi’n jough, dooinney nagh inshagh breag son ooilley’n tey ayns China.","     I have a memory of one old man, a methodist he was, a total abtainer from drink, a man who wouldn’t tell a lie for all the tea in China.",

"Myr dooyrt mee, cha jinnagh yn dooinney shoh ginsh skeealyn er chor erbee. Cre, eisht, honnick eh?","As I said, this man wouldn’t tell lies at all. What, then, did he see?",
Cre’n fa va ny shenn Vanninee ooilley credjal dy bollagh ayns y vooinjer veggey?,Why were the old Manx all believing completely in the ‘Little People’?,
Cha row ny shenn Vanninee ooilley ass nyn geeayl!,The old Manx weren’t all out of their minds!,

"     Cheayll mee keayrt dy row, mychione inneen aeg voish Colby as ish shooyl er ny sleityn faggys da’n Boayrd Runt er gerrey da Baarool.","     I heard once upon a time, about a young girl from Colby and she was walking on the mountians near to the Round Table near (South) Barrule.",
