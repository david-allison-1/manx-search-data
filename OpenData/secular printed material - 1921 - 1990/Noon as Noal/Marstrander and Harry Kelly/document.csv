Tammylt beg er dy henney va mee ronsaghey ny hrooid[1] shenn “Vrialtee Ellan Vannin” ’sy Thie Tashtee[2] ayns Doolish.,I little while ago I was researching through old “Isle of Man Examiners” in the Manx Museum[3] in Douglas.,"[1] ny hrooid] ‘through it’ – ‘trooid’ (‘through’) would have been expected here.
[2] Thie tashtee] ‘treasury’, ‘repository’, etc. used as a nickname for the Manx Museum, and sometimes given as a straight translation of ‘museum’ from the late twentieth century onwards.
[3] Thie Tashtee] ‘Storehouse’ also the nickname, that became the official Manx name for The Manx Museum.

Elswhere ‘ynnyd veaghee’ / ‘ynnyd vaghee’.,

"     Ny yeih, daag shin y ven as hooyl shin heese[10] y traid agh cha row pyagh erbee elley ry-akin.","     Nevertheless, we left the woman and we walked down the street, but there was no one else in sight.","[10] heese] ‘down’,’under’, ‘below’.

Va troor dy gheiney ayns shen as mysh shey ny shiaght kirree jeig.,There were three men there and about sixteen or seventeen sheep.,,
     V’ad lommyrt ny kirree cheu-chooylloo son lurg gee yn aiyr noa va’d broighit lesh keck as ayns gaue dy ve goit ec y carchuillag.,     They were shearing the sheep outside because after eating the new grass they were soiled with shit and in danger of being ‘taken by the fly’ (suffer fly strike).,,

Fo’n vayrn va daa hooill gial jeeaghyn magh voish eddin combaasit lesh faasaag lheeah vollagh.,Under the cap were two bright eyes looking out from a face encircled with a very shaggy grey beard.,,

"Yeeagh ad yn derrey yeh er y jeh elley, as eisht, lesh un aigney, chrie ad nyn ging. ","They looked at one another and then, with one accord, they shook their heads. ",,

[dorrys e thie’] would be expected here — ([e] ‘his’ is usually [y] in Ned Beg Hom Ruy’s work).,
Va’n ennym echey Cooke as dooyrt eh rooin ayns aght fastagh dy row eh yn cliaghtey echey dy lhaih y Vible Manninagh gagh laa.,His name was Cooke and he said to us in a pensive way that it was his custom to read the Manx Bible every day.,,

Va shin jerkal dy chlashtyn Gaelg goll er loayrt ayns shoh agh dinsh ad dooin nagh vel pyagh taggloo Gaelg nish.” ,We were expecting to hear Manx being spoken here but they told us that no one speaks Manx now.”,,
