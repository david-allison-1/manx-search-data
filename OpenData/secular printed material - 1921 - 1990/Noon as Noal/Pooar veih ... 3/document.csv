Hooar mee screeuyn voish Shorus er y chiaghtin as ayns y screeuyn va vershoonyn elley jeh “Hop Tu Naa” goit voish shenn loayreyderyn dooghyssagh bleeantyn er dy henney.,I got a letter from George in the week and in the letter were other versions of “Hop Tu Naa” taken from old native speakers years ago.,
Chur Shorus hym myrgeddin lioaran as aachlou ayn jeh paart jeh ny skeealyn v’ayn “Noon as Noal” tammylt braew er dy henney tra va Shorus stiurey y colloo.,"George also sent me a booklet with a reprint in it of some of the stories that were in “Noon as Noal” a good while ago, when George was directing the column.",
She skeealyn Neddy Hom Ruy t’ayn as ta shiuish er n’akin ad hannah.,"They are the Ned Beg Hom Ruy stories, and you have seen them already.",
Gura mie ayd ansherbee Horys!,Thank you anyway George!,
"Haink screeuyn elley hym voish Seumas Mac a’ Ghobhainn, Albinagh trean t’er n’yannoo mooarane er son cooish ny Gaelgey ’sy cheer echey hene.","Another letter came to me from Sèamus Mac a’ Ghobhainn, a heroic Scotsman who has done a lot for the subject of Gaelic in his own country.",
"Ta Seumas feer voirit mychione cooish ny chengey ayns Yn Albin, raad, t’eh gra, t’ee goll sheese ny lhargagh dy tappee agh son ny loayreyderyn er Yn Ellan Foddey (The Outer Hebrides).","Sèamus is very worried about the subject of the language in Scotland, where, he says, it is going downhill fast, except for the speakers in the ‘Far Isles’ (The Outer Hebrides).",
Ta sheshaght noa ry-hoi sauail a’ Ghàidlig er ve currit er bun as yn ennym An Comunn Albannach urree.,A new society for saving Gaelic has been established with the name An Comunn Albannach.,
"Va sheshaght elley ayn keayrt dy row enmyssit Comunn na Canain Albannach, agh, rere Seamas, t’ee marroo nish.","There was another society once called Comunn na Canain Albannach, but according to Sèamus, it is dead now.",
S’trome yn errey t’orroosyn ayns ny cheeraghyn Celtiagh as adsyn caggey er son nyn jengaghyn dooie!,How heavy is the burden upon us in the Cletic countries with those fighting for our native languages!,

(suns???) inside of us all, out of which we are all created, and some stories by our friends Robert Carswell, a new young Manx speaker.",
By haittin lhiam dy row eh ayns my vrastyl keayrt dy row as dy row mee abyl dy chooney leshyn chengey ny mayrey y ynsaghey,I was pleased that he was in my class once upon a time and that I was able to help him to learn the mother-tongue (ie; the Manx Language).,
POOAR VEIH CHESH-VEAN VRENEEN: CRE CHO GAUEAGH?,POWER FROM THE NUCLEUS OF AN ATOM: HOW DANGEROUS?,
"Ta mee er screeu mychione yn aght ta bun-stooghayn myr urraniu as raadiu spreih magh scellyn-alpha, beta as gamma.","I have written about the way elements like uranium and radium emit alpha, beta and gamma rays.",
"She ny chesh-veanyn jeh ny breneenyn shoh ta ceau magh ny scellyn: ny lectraneyn ta goll mygeayrt y chesh-vean, cha nel ad jannoo veg sy chooish shoh.","It is the nuclei of these atoms that emit the rays: the electrons that go around the nucleas, they do not do anything is this case.",
Nish ta breneen jeh sorch erbee cho beg as nagh vodmayd eh y akin.,"Now, an atom of any sort is so small that we cannot see it.",
"Dy jarroo, cha jeanmayd dy bragh breneen erbee y “akin” lesh nyn sooillyn, ga dy vodmayd soilshaghey dy vel breneenyn ayn lesh greienyn (cha nel skeeal ny chrout!).","Indeed, we will never see any atom with our eyes, although we can show that atoms exist with instruments (not a story or trick!).",
"My s’beg yn breneen, sloo foast yn chesh-vean.","If the atom is small, still smaller is the nucleus.",
"Lurg y Chied Chaggey, va fys ec fishigee dy vel corpeeyn enmyssit “protaneyn” ayns y chesh-vean jeh gagh breneen.","After the First World War, physicists knew that there are particles called protons in the nucleus of every atom.",
Ta’n protane mysh daa housane cheayrt ny strimmey na’n lectrane. ,The proton is two thousand times heavier than the electron. ,
"Ta lught lectragh ec yn phrotane as ec y lectrane neesht: lught shickyr ec yn phrotane , as lught obballagh ec yn lectrane.","The proton has an electric charge and the electron does too: the proton has a positive charge, and the electron has a negative charge.",
"     Agh cha dooar ny fishigee magh derrey ny bleeantyn jeih as feed dy vel corpeen elley sy chesh-vean, yn naeearane.","     But the physicists didn’t find out until the thirties that there is another particle in the nucleus, the neutron.",
Ta’n ennym shoh echey er y fa nagh vel lectraghys erbee ec yn naeearane.,It has this name because the nuetron has no electricity.,
Ta’n corpeen shoh beggan ny strimmey na’n protane.,This particle is a little bit heavier than the proton.,
"Er y fa dy vel chesh-veanyn jeant ass protaneyn as naeearaneyn, ta’n chesh-vean jeh breneen erbee thousaneyn dy cheayrtyn ny strimmey na’n chooid elley jeh’n vreneen (ny lectraneyn).","Because nuclei are made out of protons and neutrons, the nucleus of any atom is thousands of times heavier than the rest of the atom (the electrons).",
"Dy jarroo, ayns cooishyn chesh-veanagh, cha nel ny lectraneyn scanshoil edyr.","Indeed, nuclear matters, the electrons aren’t important at all.",
Agh ta scansh-vooar ec ny naeearaneyn.,But the nuetrons are of great importance.,
"     Mysh y toshiaght jeh’n cheead shoh, va Einstein er hoilshaghey magh dy vodmayd coontey stoo erbee dy ve goll rish “bree riojit”.","     About the beginning of this century, Einstein had explained that we can consider any material to be like “frozen energy”.",
"Ta shen dy ghra, foddee stoo goll er caghlaa gys bree, as foddee bree goll er caghlaa gys stoo.","Meaning, material can be converted to energy, and energy can be converted to material.",
"Hooar Einstein magh dy vel y vree festit seose ayns peesh dy stoo as thummid “m” echey corrym rish “m” er ny vishaghey liorish “C” kerrinit (E=MC2), raad ta “C” yn bieauid jeh sollys.[1]","Einstein discovered that the energy contained in a piece of matter having a volume “m” is equal to “m” multiplied by “C” squared (E=MC2), where “C” is the speed of light.","[1] sollys] the usual meaning in the corpus is ‘bright’, or ‘shining (adj.)’. In Irish [solas] is the noun for  ‘light’.  In late twentieth century Manx it is not unusual to find [sollys] also used as the noun for ‘light’, as well as [gial] meaning ‘white’, or ‘very light in colour’ used for ‘bright’ as in ‘shining (adj.)’. "
"My t’ou gobbraghey shoh magh, t’ou feddyn magh dy vel bree feer vooar ry-gheddyn veih beggan dy stoo.","If you work this out, you discover that really big energy is available from hardly any material.",
"Rish paart dy vleeantyn, heill ny fishigee nagh beagh ymmyd obbree dy bragh jeant jeh’n fys acadoil shoh.","For some years, the physicists imagined that there wouldn’t ever be a working application made of this academic knowledge.",
"Dy jarroo, dooyrt y fer ard-ghooagh shen Rutherford nagh beagh pooar ry gheddyn veih breneenyn dy bragh.","Indeed, that famous man Rutherford said that there wouldn’t even be power available from atoms.",
     Agh ayns 1934 ghow Fermi as fir elley toshiaght dy vleaystaney bun-stooghyn lesh naeearaneyn.,     But in 1934 Fermi and others began to bombard elements with neutrons.,
Ren skeeandee elley arrish er ny prowaltyssyn shoh.,Other scientists repeated these experiments.,
"Dyn yss dauesyn sy toshiaght, hooar ny skeeandee Giarmaanagh Hahn as Strassmann magh red yindyssagh erskyn towse; ta naeeraneyn abyl dy scoltey chesh-veanyn jeh urraaniu.","Unknown to them in the beginning, the German physicists Hahn and Strassmann discovered an incredily wonderful thing; neutrons are able to split nuclei of uranium.",
"Dy cliaghtagh, my ta chesh-vean jeh urraaniu goll er scoltey, ta daa hesh-vean noa cheet ass y taghyrt shoh.","Usually, if a nulceus of uranium is split, two new nuclei come out of this event.",
"Ta’n scoltey jeh chesh-veanyn urraaniu croo chesh-veanyn myr baariu as stointiu, ta shen dy ghra, chesh-veanyn lesh trimmid veanagh (cha nel ad feer hrome goll rish urraaniu ny leoaie as cha nel ad feer eddrym goll rish stoo-ushtey ny heeliu).","The splitting of uranium nuclei creates nuclei like barium and strontium, meaning nuclei with medium weight (density) (they aren’t very heavy like uranium or lead and they aren’t very light like hydrogen or helium).",
"Ny chesh-veanyn noa ta crooit erreish da chesh-vean urraaniu v’er ny scoltey, ta feer scell-vreeoil as gaueagh.","The new nuclei that are created after a uranium nucleus is split, is very radioactive and dangerous.",
     Cha row fys ec ny skeeandee foast c’red va goll er. Va dy liooar jeu er vleaystaney urraaniu lesh naeeraneyn as er scoltey chesh-veanyn urraaniu dyn yss daue.,     The scientists wtill didn’t know what was going on. Enough of them had bombarded uranium with neutrons and split uranium nuclei without (them) knowing.,
Agh roish foddey va fys ec sleih dy row red yindyssagh taghyrt;,But before long people knew that a wonderful thing was happening.,
va fys oc dy row ad abyl chesh-vean y scoltey dy jinnagh ad “shottal” ny chesh-veanyn shen jannoo ymmyd jeh naeearaneyn myr bulladyn beggey.,They knew that were able to split a nucleus if they “shot” those nuclei using neutrons as little bullets.,
"Ny sodjey na shen, deayshil gagh scoltey bree feer vooar — va chiass as scellyn er nyn veaysley.","Further than that, each split released huge energy — there were heat and rays released.",
"Ny sodjey na shen foast, deayshil gagh scoltey tooilley naeearaneyn as va ny naeearanyn abyl tooilley scoltaghyn y yannoo.","Still further than that, each split released more neutrons and the neutrons were able to make more splits.",
"Dy jinnagh ny scoltaghyn goll er as er, veagh bree ass towse er ny feaysley.","If the splits would continue on and on, there would be incredible energy released.",
"Dy chelleeragh, hoig ny fishigee dy row scansh vooar ec y chooish shoh.","Right away, the physicists realised that this subject had great importance.",
Oddagh bleaystan agglagh erskyn smooinaghtyn ve jeant myr shoh.,Fearful bombs beyond thinking could be made like this.,
"Dy jarroo, sy toshiaght heill sleih ennagh dy beagh y slane seihll er ny heidey seose er y fa dy jinnagh yn aa-vuilley-driaght goll er gyn scuirr!","Indeed, in the beginning some people thoug that the whole world woud be blown up because the chain reaction would continue without stopping!",
"Dy haghoil, t’eh doillee dy liooar aa-vuilley-driaght y chur fo raad ayns urraaniu ny ayns bun-stoo erbee.",Luckily it is quite difficut to get a chain reaction going in uranium or in any element.,
     Hooar ny skeeandee magh dy vel uraaniu yn-scoltey dy jeeragh roish y nah Chaggey Mooar.,     The scientists discovered that unranium is fissile just before the second World War.,
"As va’n red mirrilagh shoh er ny ’eddyn magh, sy Ghiarmaan Natseeagh cheer varbaragh va goll er reill ec fir va arryltagh dy yannoo red erbee ry hoi nyn booar y vooadaghey.","And this miraculous thing had been discovered in Nazi Germany, a barbaric country that was being ruled by men who were willing to use anything for the purpose of increasing their power.",
Begin da ram skeeandee Hewnagh chea veih ny Natseeyn.,Many Jewish scientists had to flee from the Nazis.,
She ny Hewnyn shen as skeeandee elley ren scapail veih Hitler ren cur er ny Sostynee as ny Americanee bleaystan breneenagh y yannoo.,It was those Jews and other scientists who escaped from Hitler who made the English and the Americans make an atomic bomb.,
Heill ny skeeandee shoh (dy aggairagh!) dy row ny Natseeyn er chee geddyn greim er bleaystan breneenagh hoshiaght.,These scientists guessed (wrongly!) that the Nazis were about to get hold of an atomic bomb first.,

"Ren mee geddyn y skeeal shoh voish Juan y Craine, ta baghey ayns Colby foast, as hooar eshyn y skeeal voish e haner hene.","I got this story from John Craine, who lives in Colby still, and he got the story from his own grandfather.",
"     Ansherbee, va shaner Yuan baghey ayns Ronague, as eshyn ny ghooinney aeg, agh v’eh gobbragh da’n ghaaue-dhoo ayns Colby ec y cheirdee aynshen.","     Anyway, John’s grandfather was living in Ronague, when he was a young man, but he was working for the blacksmith in Colby at the smithy there.",
"     Dagh moghrey yinnagh eh goll voish Ronague gys Colby, as gagh fastyr yinnagh eh cheet er-ash, as dy jarroo ayns ny shenn laghyn shen, v’eh cliaghtey shooyl y raad.","     Every morning he would go from Ronague to Colby, and every afternoon he would come back, and indeed in those old days he used to walk (all) the way.",
"     Well, ayns y gheurey yinnagh eh shooyl y raad ’sy dorraghys agh cha row eh boirit er chor erbee er yn oyr nagh row eh cur credjue da buitchyn, as pishagyn as y lhied.","     Well, in the winter he would walk the way in the dark but he wasn’t bothered at all because he didn’t believe in witches, and spells and such.",
     Fastyr dy row v’eh shooyl er-ash gys Ronague ayns dorraghys feer feer ghowin.,     One afternoon he was walking back to Ronague in very very deep darkness.,
"Ansherbee, raink eh boayl faggys da’n thie echey, as eisht ren eh sheiltyn dy row feiyr quaagh ayn.","Anyway, he arrived at a place near to his house, and then he imagined that there was a strange noise.",
"Dy jarroo, va’n fieyr quaagh ayn ny chooyl er y raad.","Indeed, the strange noise was there, behind him on the way (road).",
"     Scuirr eh, agh cha row veg ry-chlashtyn ec y traa shen.","     He stopped, but there was nothing to be heard at that time.",
Hie eh er e hoshiaght reesht.,He went ahead again.,
"As reesht, feiyr quaagh. ","And again, a strange noise. ",
Scuirr eh reesht as scuirr y feiyr myrgeddin.,He stopped again and the noise stopped too.,
     Agh yn dooinney boght.,     But the poor man.,
"Nish v’eh fo aggle ass myghin, as roie eh.","Now he was mericlessly afraid, and he ran.",
Agh v’an feiyr quaagh foast geiyrt er.,But the strange noise was still following him.,
"Fy yerrey hoal ren eh cosney gys y thie echey, as v’eh ny hassoo roish y dorrys.","Finally he made it to his house, and he was standing before the door.",
"Ren eh ronsaghey dy jeean ayns poggaidyn e chooat, shirrey er yn ogher, as foast va’n feiyr quaagh cheet dy ve syrjey as sniessey, as eisht, doaltattym — she eddin v’ayn.","He searched keenly in the pockets of his coat, looking for the key, and still the strange noise was becoming louder and closer, and then, suddenly — it was a face.",
"     Va enn mie echey er yn eddin shen, son shickyrys — va eddin as daa hooill sollys aynjee, as faasaag liauyr, as ... daa eairk.","     He recognised that face well, certainly — there was face with two bright eyes, a long beard, and ... two horns.",
"     Dy jarroo, eddin y Youl hene.","     Indeed, the face of the Devil himself.",
"Agh cha nee agh goayr v’ayn, as geuley brisht mygeayrt e wannal.","But it was only a goat, with a broken chain around its neck.",
Va’n geuey brisht croghey sheese as cur magh y feaiyr quaagh er y raad.,The broken chain was hanging down and putting out the strange noise on the highway.,
     Hooar mee skeeal elley voish Juan y Craine mychione ny shenn laghyn v’ayn.,     I got another story from John Craine about the old days that were.,
"     Va shaner Yuan baghey ayns y Jiass, myr dooyrt mee roie.","     John’s grandfather was living in the South, as I said.",
"Well, ec y traa shen, va ny deiney aegey ’sy Jiass cliaghtey goll dys Skyll Andreays ry-hoi gienseyn va goll er cummal aynshen.","Well, at that time, the young men in the South used to go to Kirk Andreas for parties that were being held there.",

Sometimes, they would make it to their houses at a right  time for eating their breakfast, and then off they went to their work.",
