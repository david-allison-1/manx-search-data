Honnick eh ad scruit er boalley ennagh ’sy Nerin tammylt er dy henney, ass y Yernish as ny focklyn bentyn rish Nerin hene.","I got these words from George Broderick a day or two ago. He saw them written on some wall in Ireland a while ago, in Irish and the words were referring to Ireland itself.",
"Dooyrt yn Eaghtyrane marroo Eamonn De Valera bunnys yn red cheddin kuse dy vleeantyn er dy henney tra dinsh eh da chaglym Yernagh, “T’eh ny share Gaelg vrisht y loayrt na dyn Gaelg edyr”.","The late President of Ireland, Eamon De Valera said almost the same thing a few years ago when he told an Irish gathering “It is better to speak broken Irish than without Gaelic at all”.",
"Dy mennick ta mee er ve smooinaghtyn my­chione ny focklyn shen, as er lheh nish ayns Mannin, tra ta ny brastyllyn geuree goaill toshiaght.","Often, I have been thinking about those words, and especially now in the Isle of Man, when the winter classes begin.",
"Lhisagh shin ooilley nyn gooid share y yannoo dy loayrt ass Gaelg as dy reayll ee bio, gyn scansh y chur da marranyn vees aynjee tra loayrys mayd ee.","We should all do our best to speak Manx and to keep it alive, without giving  regard to errors that will be in it when we speak it.",

"S’cummey lesh ny marranyn! Loayr-jee Gaelg as jean-jee nyn gooid share, myr yiarragh Ned Maddrell, dy “reayll ee bio!”","Mistakes do not matter!  Speak Manx and do your best, as Ned Maddrell would say, to “keep it alive!”",
TURRYS MYGEAYRT NALBIN,AN EXCURSION AROUND SCOTLAND,
Ta my ven as mee hene kiart nish er ash voish turrys ny hrooid[1] Nalbin. S’taittin lhiam ginsh diu dy vel Nalbin ayns cree mie erskyn insh.,My wife and myself are just back from an excursion through Scotland. How pleased I am to tell you that Scotland is in inredicly good heart (spirits).,[1] ny hrooid] ‘through it’. [trooid] ‘through’ would be expected here.
"Ta’n chengey Ghaelgagh bishaghey as ta’n cheer hene slane dooisht dy politickagh, ta ny smoo argid cheet stiagh na va rieau er dy henney[2], as erskyn ooilley, ta ny Halbinee slane skee jeh’n cochiangley t’er ve eddyr ocsyn as Sostyn rish ny smoo na daa cheead vlein.","The Gaelic tongue is flourishing and the country itself is fully politically awake, there is more money coming in than there ever was before, and above all, the Scots are entirely fed up of the connection which has been between them and England for more than two hundred years.","[2] na va rieau er dy henney] — the intended meaning is evidently ‘than ever before’, for which [na er-dy-rieau] or [na va rieau] would be expected.  [na va va rieau er dy henney] means ‘than there was ever since’. "
T’ad skee jeh'n “punt sinkeil” as ta mee braew shickyr vees slane seyrsnys oc roish feer foddey.,They are fed up with the “sinking pound” and I am quite certain they will have complete independence before very long.,

The new boats are not in any way like the old boats for comfort, these new diesel boats are awfully noisy when they sail with their engine knocking throughout the night like a the noise of some agricultural machine.",

"Cheau shin un oie ayns Stroin Yn Cheean (Strontian) as eisht hie shin lesh shilley er Blaar Atholl as Balley Morail (Balmoral) agh cha vaik shin ee hene aynshen edyr!

All around Scotland there are words written on rocks and such, “Up with Gaelic”, “Independence!”, and the whole excursion was good for my heart.",
"Ta un cheer Celtiagh ayn dy jarroo as aavioghey Celtiagh er bun, as  ta shen Nalbin!

I was speaking for a while to the Director of  An Comunn Gaidhealach (‘The Gaelic Association’) (Their ‘Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh’), and he was in good heart concerning the subject of Gaelic in his country. ",

Ta treisht orrym[3] dy jig caghlaa mooar myr shoh ayns Mannin erreish da’n Reihys shoh cheet.,I hope a great change like this will come in the Isle of Man after this coming election.,"[3] Ta treisht orrym] literally ‘There is a trust / hope upon me’, an idiom unattested in Classical Manx — [Ta mee treishteil], or [Ta treisht aym] would be expected here."
REIHYS DREE[4]?,A TEDIUS ELECTION?,"[4] Reihys Dree] ‘A Slow Election’, [dree] ‘slow’ used here to mean ‘boring’, ‘tedius’, ‘uninteresting’."
"Loayrt mychione y Reihys, cha nel monney ry chlashtyn foast vouesyn ta shirrey goll stiagh 'sy Chiare As Feed!","Talking about the Election, there isn’t much to be heard yet from those who are seeking to enter the Keys!",

"Ayns ny laghyn moghey Vec Mannin[7], hoig shin dy tappee dy beagh eh ymmyrchagh cur bleaystan breneenagh fo ny Manninee dy ghoostey ad ass nyn gadley neupholitickagh. ",In the early days of Mec Vannin we undertood quickly that it would be necessary to put atomic bombs under the Manx to wake them out of their unpolitical sleep. ,[7] ny laghyn moghey Vec Mannin] 
"T’eh jeeaghyn dooys dy vel ad foast nyn gadley. Agh heemayds lurg tammylt.

But we will see after a while. I am the agent for Audery Ainsworth, and a week ago I saw Mec Vannin’s ‘manifesto’ for the first time and it’s exceedingly good. ",
"Cha dod Manninagh dooie erbee teiy noi shen ny ta scruit ayn, shenn Vanninagh ny Manninagh noa.","A true Manx person couldn’t vote against that which is written in it,  an old Manx person or a new Manx person.",

","Bunneydys 2 came  to me from Brian Stowell a while ago, and it was wonderful to cast my eye over his good work..","[8] b’yndyssagh eh] ‘it was wonderful’. Outside of set phrases, [by] ([b’)before a vowel], the past tense of [s’] is only usually productive in Classical Manx, and then only as a superlative, eg; [b’aaley] ‘(was) most beautiful’, [b’yrjee] ‘(was) highest’, etc. "
"Dynsee mee ram Gaelg noa tra lhaih mee ny hrooid, as ayns y lioaran honnick mee laue Robert Mac Thomysh dy mennick as yn Ghaelg lettyragh yindyssagh echeysyn! ","I learnt a lot new Manx when I read through it, and in the booklet I often saw the hand of Robert Thomson and his wonderful literary Manx! ",
Ta treisht orrym[9] dy jig magh y lioaran shoh dy tappee cour ymmyd ny brastyllyn mleeaney.,I hope this booklet will come out fast for use of the classes this year,"[9] Ta treisht orrym] literally ‘There is a trust / hope upon me’, an idiom unattested in Classical Manx — [Ta mee treishteil], or [Ta treisht aym] would be expected here."
TOMMY LEECE,TOMMY LEECE,
"Myr screeu mee roie, ta ymmoddee Gaelgeyryn aegey laccal caslyssyn jeh’n shenn sleih vouesyn hooar y sheeloge aym pene chengey ny mayrey. Er hoh diu fer elley, Thomaase Leece (ayns Gaelg chiart — Thomaase Mac Guilley Yeesey).","As I wrote before, there are many young Gaelic speakers who want illustrations of the old people from whom my generation got the mother tongue. Here for you is another, Thomas Leece (in correct Manx — Thomaase Mac Guilley Yeesey).",
"Ren Tom beaghey ayns y Cherroo Keyl (narrow quarterland) nish scruit dy aggairagh “Kerroo-keeil” ayns Jiass ny h-Ellan, kiart fo Barroole Jiass.","Tom lived in the Kerroo Keyl (narrow quarterland) now written wrongly ‘Kerroo-keeil’ in the South of the Island, right under South Barrule.",

"Cha bee dy jarroo e lhied ayn arragh! Dobbree Thobm ’syn Africk Yiass rish kuse dy vleeantyn, ayns Johannesburg ayns ny meainyn airh.","There certainly won’t be the like of him again! Tom worked in South Africa for a few years, in Johannesburg in the gold mines.",
Tra v’eh ny scollag v'eh gobbragh ayns meainyn Forsdal as dinsh eh dooin dy row Gaelg ec ooilley ny shenn deiney v’eh gobbragh marish as nagh row monney Baarle oc ny keayrtyn.,When he was an older child he was working in Foxdale mines and he told us that all the old men he was working with knew Manx and that they didn’t have much English sometimes.,

 “Va Charlie Breagagh yn chied fer ren mee rieau clashtyn loayrt Gaelg twoaie — She Gaelg vie v'echey dy jarroo agh va blass quaagh echey.” ," ‘Charlie Breagagh was the first one I ever heard speaking Northern Manx — It was good Manx he had indeed, but he had a strange accent.”",
"(Then he broke into English, as the old speakers were wont to do for em­phasis). “He had good Manx right enough but there was an awful twang arrim and usin’ words we wern’t hearin' in the South”.",,
"Ta Thobm oanluckit ’sy rhullick ec Skeerey Cairbre, faggys da dorrys ny killagh. Dagh ooilley cheayrt ta mee goll shaghey ta mee goaill padjer beg er e hon, as er son Sage Kinvig as e sheshey.

Every time I go past I have a little prayer for him, and for Sage Kinvig and her husband. More about them next week.",

As it is written in the Bible, “The floods rose” during September, as they rose in Mann since Adam was a boy.",

"In Ireland they pride themselves that the countryside has ""forty shades of green"". Is it not time that we stopped this annual nonsense in Mann about ""water shortages""? We must have sixty shades of green over here, under the grey, weeping skies of Ellan Vannin.",,
HYMN NOA VOISH L.V.C.,,
Va Chalse y Gardey as Chalse y Cain shirrey “Hark the Herald Angels Sing” ’sy Ghaelg cour shirveish ny Nollick.,Charles Guard and Charles Cain were asking for “Hark the Herald Angels Sing” in Manx for the Christmas Service.,
