CHEER NY GREINEY,The Country of the Sun,
"     Myr screeu mee shiaghtyn er dy henney, va’n obbyr fo-halloo feer ghanjeyragh as doccaragh ny keayrtyn.","     As I wrote a week ago, the work underground was very dangerous and hard sometimes.",

By liooar dou ny shey bleeantyn va mee ec yn obbyr shen.,The six years I was at that work was enough for me.,
"Va mee gobbragh mysh kiare thousane trie fo eaghtyr y thallooin ayns dorraghys doo, jeh’n lhied nagh nione diuish ta gobbragh er ooir aalin Yee.","I was working about four thousand feet under the surface of the earth in pitch dark, of the like you who work on God’s beautiful earth don’t know.",
Va shin thiolley as bleaystey gagh laa as er y fa shen cha nel yn clashtyn aym cha mie as oddagh eh ve agh er lhiam dy vel my scowanyn kiart dy liooar.,"We were  boring holes and blasting every day and therefore my hearing isn’t as good as it could be, but I think that my lungs are right enough.",
Ta mee er n’akin shenn veaineyderyn as ny scowanyn oc slane stroit lesh joan-creggey.,I have seen old miners with their lungs completely destroyed by rock dust.,
Dy mennick va shin eignit dy obbraghey rish daa oor yeig ’sy laa ny daa oor yeig ’syn oie as ny keayrtyn shiaght laghyn ’sy chiaghtin.,"Often, we had to work for twelve hours a day or twleve hours a night and sometimes seven days a week.",
     Keayrt dy row va ooilley ny traenyn fo-halloo fo my churrym.,"     At one time, I was responsible for all the underground trains.",
"Un oie huitt tunneyder (tunnel) stiagh orrin agh ren shin scapail lesh nyn mioys, bwooise da Jee.","One night a tunnel fell in on us , but we escaped with our lives, thank God.",
Keayrt elley va mee gobbragh heese ec bun slogh (shaft) as gheayrt queig millioon galloon d’ushtey neose orrym pene as er tree deiney doo.,"Another time, I was working down at the base of a shaft and five million gallons of water poured down on myself and three black men.",
Reeshtagh ren shin scapail agh va daa ghooinney doo elley gobbragh faggys dooin as vaih ad ’syn ushtey.,"Again, we escaped, but there were other black men working near to us and they drowned in the water.",
Kegeesh ny lurg shen hooar shin nyn girp tra va’n ushtey pumpit magh.,A fortnight after that we found their bodies when the water was pumped out.,
By liooar shen dooys fo-halloo.,That was enough for me underground.,
Hooar mee staartey er yn eaghtyr ayns rheynn elley jeh’n cholught as cheau mee my hraa jerrinagh ’syn Africkey ayns y Thie-sheelee (refinery) raad va shin glenney y coobyr as aa-ghlenney eh reesht lesh electolysis derrey v’eh 99% glen.,I got a job on the surface in another department of the company and I spent my final time in Africa in the refinery where we were cleaning (purifying) the copper and and re-cleaning it again with electolysis until it was 99% pure.,
"     Ta shenn raa ’sy Ghaelg, “Raad ta chionnal erbee ayn yiow shiu Manninagh” as dy jarroo va Manninagh ny ghaa gobbragh marym agh cha ren mee fakin monney jeu edyr.","     There’s a old Manx saying, “Where there’s any crowd you’ll find a Manx person” and indeed there were many Manxmen working with me, but I didn’t see many of them at all.",
Ta troor jeu nish baghey ayns Mannin as ta mee fakin ad ny keayrtyn as ta shin loayrt ass y ghlare “Cibemba” ry-cheilley.,There are three of them now living in the Isle of Man and I see them sometimes and we talk in the “Cibemba” language to each other.,

V'eh feer cheh ’sy voayl shen as dooyrt eh rhym dy beagh eh yindyssagh dy ennaghtyn paart dy “cooth” voish Ellan Vannin.,It was very hot in that place and he said to me that it would be wonderful to feel some of the “cooth” (‘cold’ in Anglo-Manx dialect) from the Isle of Man. ,
Cha row monney “cooth” fo-halloo ’sy veain edyr!,"There wasn’t much “cooth” underground in the mine, at all!",
"Va ny deiney doo credjal dy bollagh ayns scanjoonyn as spyrrydyn as va ram buill fo-halloo raad nagh ragh ad er cor erbee, eer dy beagh ad ceaut magh ass nyn staataghyn son gobbal dy gholl stiagh ayndoo.","The black men thoroughly believed in apparitions (ghosts) and spirits and there were many places underground where they wouldn’t go at all, even if they were to be thrown out of their jobs for refusing to go into them.",
Ny keayrtyn v’eh orrym d’aagail ad my yei as goll roym my lomarcan as adsyn foaddey aile dy reayll ersooyl ny drogh spyrrydyn.,Sometimes I had to leave them behind me and go alone with them lighting a fire to keep away the evil spirits.,
Tra harrin er ash yiarrin roo dy vaik mee ram scanjoonyn as yinnagh ad roie gollrish yn jouyll hene dy chosney ersooyl voish y voayl neuluckee shen.,When I would come back I would say to them that I saw a lot of ghosts and they would run like the devil himself to get away from that unlucky place.,

(Cha nod sleih ayns Goal gra y fockle dy kiart – t’ad gra “apart-hide” agh ta’n fockley-magh kiart “apart-hate”.,(People in Britain can’t say the word correctly — they say “apart-hide” but the correct pronunciation is “apart-hate”.,
Screeu ommidan ennagh keayrt dy row dy vel shoh er yn oyr dy vel ny kynneeyn cur feoh er y cheilley as adsyn scarrit!).,"Some fool once wrote that this is the reason that the races hate each other, with them being separated!)",
Raad va mish gobbraghey cha row “apartheid” ayn agh cha row ny kynneeyn goll mygeayrt monney ry-cheilley agh son yn traa v’ad gobbraghey.,"Where I was working there wasn’t “apartheid” but the races didn’t go around much together, except for the time they were working together.",
Ta ny deiney doo feer voyrnagh ass y chynney ocsyn as ta ram j’eu smooinaghtyn nagh vel ny kynneeyn baney feeu son veg.,The black men are very proud of their language and there are a lot of them thinking that the white races aren’t worth anything.,
"Cha nel adsyn shirrey co-phoosey marish feallagh baney er chor erbee, chamoo ta’n feallagh baney laccal y lhied.","They aren’t asking for inter-marriage with white ones (folk) at all, neither do the white ones want such a thing.",
"Tra t’ou smooinaghtyn er, cha nel shin fakin ny foillanyn as ny troghanyn troggal nyn idd ’syn un voayl ayns Mannin.","When you think about it, we don't see the seagulls and the rooks building their nests in the same place in the Isle of Man.",

"Dreggyr Schweitzer, ard-sushtallagh as fer-lhee, huc ooilley e vioys da’n feallagh doo,[1] “Ta shiu dy jarroo kiart as ta’n dooinney doo my vraar gyn ourys, agh — he is my younger brother by many centuries”.","Schweitzer, a chief evangelist and doctor,  answered, to them all his life for the black ones (folk), “You are indeed correct and the black man is my brother without doubt, but — he is my younger brother by many centuries”.","[1] huc ooilley e vioys da’n feallagh doo] ‘to them all his life for the black ones (folk)’ there seems to be either a typo, error, or missing word in this phrase. "
Er lhiam dy vel shen ansoor feer chooie as dy row yn irriney echey.,I think that that is a very suitable answer and that he knew the truth.,
Ayns Yn Africkey Yiass hene (yn phoblaght) ta’n apartheid feer eajee.,In South Africa itself (the republic) apartheid is really despicable.,

",
"as dooyrt eh, Cursit vees Canaan, sharvaant dy harvaantyn vees eh da e vraaraghyn.”","And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.”",

"Ta ram reddyn olk er ve jeant ’sy theihll shoh ayns ennym craueeaght, s’olk lhiam gra.","There are many evil things that have been done in this world in the name of religion, I hate to say.",

",

","     The English in South Africa don’t think much of the Boers at all, and they have a secret society called “The Sons of England”, a sort of quasi-masonic society with three degrees (levels) in it.",
"She voish yn sheshaght shen dy daink yn eie hym dy chur er bun “Mec Vannin”, red ren mee tra haink mee er ash dy valley ’sy vlein 1962.","It is from that society that the idea came to me to establish “Mec Vannin”, something I did when I came back home in the year 1962.",
Agh cha nel tree keimyn ayns Mec Vannin as er lhiam nagh vel “ritual” oc foast!,But there aren’t three degrees (levels) in Mec Vannin and I don’t think they have a “ritual” yet!,
