The Manx sang in Pare Moustolr (a football field) on Saturday afternoon and although we were the smallest group present, we received an excellent welcome.",

Va shey follee[1] freaylt voish dagh ooilley ashoon va kionfenish ec y Feailley, myr shen va dagh ooilley fer jeh ny Manninee er nyn guirrey.","The Manx were the same group that were singing there. There were six folk reserved from every nation who were present at the Festival, so everyone of the Manx were invited. ","[1]shey follee] [shey feallagh] ‘six folk’. Elsewhere, [feallagh] is a non-count collective noun, usually meaning ‘ones’, as in [feallagh elley] ‘other ones’. [shey perrsoonyn] would be expected here (although, some speakers, perhaps taking exception to the loanword [persoon], might use [shey dy ’leih]."
Ghow Anne Inney Kissack arrane as dooyrt dagh ooilley pheiagh dy vel coraa yindyssagh eck.,Miss Anne Kissack sang and everyone said that she has a wonderful voice.,

     Hooar mee yn caslys shoh heese voish nyn garrey Juan y Geill er y chiaghtin.,     I got this picture below from our friend John Gell in the week.,
"Myr ta fys ec y chooid smoo dy lhaihderyn “Noon As Noal,” ta Juan, myr ymmodee Manninee dooie, jeh’n chenn sorch ny Saasilagh eh hene as t’eh er y “Phlan” myr preachoor.","As most readers of “Noon as Noal” know, Juan is himself, as are so many native Manx, of the old sort of Methodist and he is on the ‘Plan’ as a preacher.",
S’himmey sharmane mie ass chengey ny mayrey ta shin er chlashtyn voish Juan y Geill car ny bleeantyn t’er n’gholl shaghey.,How many good sermons in the native tongue we have heard from John Gell during the years gone past.,
"Er hoh ny screeu Juan — “Bentyn da’n Chabbal Saasilagh Purt Le Moirrey bee ymmodee shenn Vanninee treih as trimshagh clashtyn dy vel ee ry chreck er coontey jeh ny cooinaghtyn oc jeh’n chenn Chabbal, chammah mie as sie.”","This is what John wrote — “Concerning Port St Mary Methodist Chapel, many old Manx people will be miserable and sad hearing that it is for sale, on account of their memories of the old Chapel, good as well as bad.",
S'treih lhiams myrgeddin er yn oyr dy vel mee coontey ee dy ve ...[3] ghaa ny tree jeh ny kialteenyn s’aaley ayns y Jiass. ,"I’m sorry too, because I consider it to be (one of) two or three of the most beautiful churchs in the South. ","[3] There appears to be missing words here, the translation assumes those words to be ‘nane jeh’."
"V’ee troggit mysh 1895 as va ghaa ny tree jeh my vooinjer hene gobbragh urree chammah seyir-thie as masoonee, as ren ad ‘job mie’ !","It was built around 1895 and there were a few of my own people working on it both joiners and masons, and they did a good job!",
"Va ny claghyn er n’gheddyn ass y quarral er y chronk as ta’n fuygh cheusthie ooilley juys-pick, cha mie nish as yn laa v’eh currit stiagh.","     The stones were got from the quarry on the hill and the wood inside is all pitch-pine, as good now as the day it was put up.",
"Rish kiare feed vlein ta’n chabbal er ve cowrey-halloin as dy beagh ee lhieggit sheese, c’red oddys shassoo ’syn ynnyd shen?","     For eighty years the chapel has been a landmark and if she were to be knocked down, what could stand in that place?",
Glout ard graney dy choncraid? Nar lhig eh Jee !,An ugly tall lump of concrete? God forbid!,
"Er hoh caslys diu jeh Purt Le Moirrey as “Traie Ny Cabbal” mysh 1900, lesh y thie mooar bane “Rocklands” ayns y vean as y chabbal noa er y laue yesh. ","Here is a picture for you of Port St Mary and Chapel Beach around 1900, with the big white house “Rocklands” in the middle and the new chapel on the right side. ",
Hee shiu er y chaslys nagh row y shoolaghan jeant foast er y traie. Cha row shen troggit derrey 1907.,You’ll see in the picture that the promenade wasn’t yet made on the beach. That wasn’t built until 1907.,
Yn Cabbyl Ushtey,The Water Horse,
"Tra va mee chaglym as kiaddey focklyn noa-emshiragh da’n ’ockleyr Baarle-Gaelg, hug mee stiagh y fockle 'cabbyl awin' son ‘hippopotamus’. Cha nel fockle erbee elley cooie as kiart ayn as ta ‘cabbyl awin’ bun yn ’ockle Ladjin-Ghreagagh shen!","When I was collecting and forming modern words for the English-Manx Dictionary, I put in the word ‘river horse’ for ‘hippopotamus. There isn’t any other word that is suitable and correct and ‘river horse’ is the basis of than Latin-Greek word!",
"Cha nel fockle elley ec ny Sostynee ayns y ghlare yindyssagh oc, cha nel fockle erbee ‘sy Vaarle son y baagh shen as t’ad eignit dy yannoo ymmyd jeh fockle lieh Ladjin as lieh Greagish!","The English don’t have another word in their wonderful language, there isn’t any word in English for that animal and they are compelled to make use of a half-Latin and half-Greek word!",
"Agh ga nagh row 'cabbil awin' ry akin ayns struanyn as awinyn glen Vannin, va sorch dy chabbyl awin elley ayn ayns ny shenn laaghyn as yn ennym ersyn “Yn Cabbyl Ushtey”![4]","But although a ‘river horse’ wasn’t visible in the clean streams and rivers of Mann, there was another sort of river horse in the old days and the name of it was “The Water Horse”!","[4] Yn Cabbyl Ushtey] — a malicious creature in Manx folklore, takes the form of a horse and drowns its victims."
"Va ny cabbil ushtey shoh dy mennick fakinit liorish hennayraghyn[5], cheet ass dubbaghyn mooarey as awinyn ny h-Ellan as verragh ad aggle mooar atchimagh orroosyn shen haink ny whail oc!","     These water horses were often seen by (my) ancestors, coming out of the big dubs (pools) and rivers of the Island and they would put terrible great fear in those who met them!","[5] hennayraghyn] lenited form of ‘shennayraghyn’, the lenition suggests a missing word, the translation assumes this word to be ‘my’."
"     Nane jeh ny dubbaghyn share son fakin yn Cabbyl Ushtey she’n dubbey mooar ayns awin Ghlion Rheynn Eas v’eh, nish bannit liorish yn ennym “Glen Helen” ayns Baarle! ","One of the best dubs for seeing the Cabbyl Ushtey — it was the big dub in the Glen Rhenass river, now blessed by the name “Glen Helen” in English! ",
"Ta sleih gra dy vel yn ennym “Glen Helen” cheet voish ennym y ’neen Helen Marsden, ’neen da’n dooinney b’lesh y ghlion keayrt dy row. Kys ta ny Baarleyryn er chaghlaa enmyn aalin Vannin car ny bleeantyn.","People say that the name “Glen Helen” comes from the name of the girl Helen Marsden, a daughter of the man who owned the glen once upon a time. How the English speakers have changed the beautiful names of Mann through the years.",
"Cha row ny cabbil ushtey shoh ry akin ayns Mannin ny lomarcan agh ooilley mygeayrt y theihll Ghaelgagh. Ayns Nalbin v’ad enmyssit yn “each uisge,” ta shen dy ghra ’sy Vaarle Albinagh, yn ‘Kelpie.’","These water horse were to be seen in the Isle of Man alone, but all around the Gaelic world. In Scotland they were called the “each uisge”, which is to say in Scots English the ‘Kelpie’.",
"Va boayl er lheh ayns Mannin, myr dooyrt mee roie heose, as er hoh diu caslys jeh’n dubbyr ayns Awin Rheynn Eas en­myssit “Spooyt Ny Gabbil.” ","There was a special place in Mann, as I said before above, and here for you is a picture of the dub in the Rhenass river called ‘The Spout of the Horses.” ",
"Veeit mee rish dooinney ’sy thie oast ec Cronk Keeill Eoin un oie as dinsh eh dou nagh jagh yn jishag echey rieau faggys da'n dubbyr shen, er oie as er laa noadyr, er yn oyr dy vaik yn jishag echeysyn red ennagh quaagh erskyn insh cheet magh ass yn ushtey un oie ec keeiragh ny hoie ’sy vlein 1892, tra v’eh ny ghuilley aeg as eshyn shooyl ny lomarcan seose yn awin geiyrt er kirree yn ayrey echey va gyndyr heose er y clieau ta enmyssit Yn Beary.","I met a man in the pub at Tynwald Hill one night and he told me that his dad would never go near that dub, neither at night nor day, because his dad saw something too strange to tell coming out of the water one night at dusk in the year 1892, when he was a young boy whilst he was walking alone up the river following his father’s sheep that were grazing up on the mountain that’s called The Beary.",
S’quaagh eh yn aght va ny shenn Vanninee fakin reddyn neuheiltagh as credjal ayndoo neesht. ,"How strange it is, the way the old Manx were seeing unworldly things and believing in them too. ",
"Dinsh my ayr aym pene dou keayrt dy row dy row enney echeysyn er shenn Vanninee crauee, ynrick as ynsit, as adsyn loo er nyn lhiabbaghyn baaish dy row ad er n’akin ny ferrishyn!","My own father told me once that he knew old religious Manx people, honest and educated, and them swearing on their death-beds that they had seen the fairies!",

Those old people weren’t liars in any way and they were always sober and teetotal, against drink, believing in God and the Bible and every word that’s in the Bible and they wouldn’t tell lies for all the tea in China.",
"Ta shinyn gearey orroo as craidey moo ny keayrtyn agh cre mysh ny skaalyn etlagh t’ayn nish? Vel shiu credjal ayndoo ny dyn? Er my hon hene, cha s’ayms !","We laugh at and mock them sometimes, but what about the flying saucers there are now? Do you believe in them ot not? For myself, I don’t know!",

"Mastey’n sleih va screeu rish y lioaran shen va Manninagh voish Balley Chashtal ayns eebyrtys 'sy Chanadey ayns balley enmyssit Kirkland Lake, Ontario. Va Gaelg ec y Vanninagh shen as va’n ennym ersyn Juan y Comish. ","Among the people who were writing to that pamphlet was a Manxman from Castletown in exile in Canada in a town called Kirkland Lake, Ontario. That Manxman had Manx, and his name was John Comish. ",
"Ayns ny shiaghteeyn ry heet t’eh foym paart jeh ny skeealyn echeysyn y chlou ayns “Noon as Noal,” er lheh erreish da’n 17 Mean Fouyir tra veeyms, lesh cooney Yee er my laghyn seyrey marish my ven ayns Nalbin rish kegeesh as bee eh orrym faagail stoo ry hoie tree shiaghteeyn marish yn “Rollage” dy lhieeney yn colloon shoh.","In the weeks to come I intend to print some of his stories in “Noon as Noal,” especially after the 17th of September when I will be, with God’s help, on my holidays with my wife in Scotland for a fortnight and I will have to leave material for three weeks with the “Star” to fill this column.",
"Ta Juan y Comish marroo nish agh ta ny skeealyn echey feer vie dy jarroo as nish, tra ta shin ooilley chaglym skeealyn Gaelgagh ry hoi clou ad, er lhiam dy bee shiu ooilley er nyn yannoo magh lhaih paart ny va screeuit ec y Vanninagh ooasle shoh.","John Comish is dead now, but his stories are very good indeed and now, when we are all collecting Manx stories for the purpose of printing them, I think you will all be satisfied reading some of what was written by this noble Manxman.",
