Hooar Phillie baase roish yn Nah Chaggey as er y fa shen cha bee enney er eer yn ennym echey ec monney sleih nish., Philly died before the Second (World) War and therefore not many people will even know his name now.,
     Haink mee ny whail ayns aght quaag.,     I met him in an unusual way.,

"     Fastyr Jedoonee dy row hug mee lhiams moir adsyn va ching[3] dys Doolish dy chur shilley orroo — as shen va kied ayn dy yannoo, trooid yn uinnag.

The expected phrase would be [hug mee lhiam yn voir ocsyn va ching].
Er yn raad er-ash dy valley vrie y ven my oddin goll trooid Purt ny h-Inshey dy insh da ny fir-vooinjer eck ayns shen kys va ny paitchyn eck goll er.,On the way back home the woman asked if I could go through Peel to tell her relatives there how the children were getting on.,

Fy-yerrey dooyrt mee rish, “Vel shen y Vible t’ou lhaih, Vainshter?”","I didn’t think at this time that there was anyone left in the world who was reading a  Manx Bible .
