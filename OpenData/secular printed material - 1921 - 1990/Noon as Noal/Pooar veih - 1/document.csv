POOAR VEIH CHESH-VEAN Y VRENEEN: CRE CHO GAUEAGH?,POWER FROM THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM: HOW DANGEROUS?,
YN shiaghtin shoh ta daa art aym voish daa charrey mooar ny Gaelgey Brian Mac Stoyl as Shorys.,"This week I have are two articles from two great friends of Manx, Brian Stowell and George.",
"By haittin lhiam ad ny neesht y akin shiaghtin Jedoonee shoh chaie, hoshiaght ec Eairy Cushlin as ny lurg shen ayns Breck-y-Broom (ta shen ennym voish y chenn Loghlinish “Brekkubrunnr” — “Slope Burn”).","I would enjoyed seeing them both a week last Sunday, first at Eairy Cushlin and after that in Breck-y-broom (Brackabroom) (that is the name from the old Norse “Brekkubrunnr” — “Slope Burn”).",
"Ta strooan beg roie voish y boayl shen stiagh ’syn awin ""Neb"" (""Yn Feb (f)?""). ",There is a little stream running from that place into the river “Neb”  (“Yn Feb (f)?”). ,
Cha nel fys ec pyagh erbee er bun yn ennym “Neb”.,No one knows about the meaning of the name “Neb”.,
Foddee dy vel yn ennym voish chengey foddey shinney na’n Ghaelg. ,Maybe the name is from a tongue far older than Manx.,
Ayns 1648 (rere J.J. Kring) v’ee enmyssit “Y Feb”.,In 1648 (according to J.J. Kneen) it was called “The Feb”.,
"Ta’n Awin Neb roie ny hrooid-y gharey ain as t’ee lane dy vrack, thunnaghyn as astanyn.","The River Neb runs through our garden and it is full of trout, ducks and eels.",
Ec y traa t’ayn t’ee feer thanney[1] (shallow).,At the present time it is very shallow. ,[1] feer thanney] text; [feer hanney]
,,
TA feyshtey Windscale goll er ec y traa t’ayn kyndagh rish gyere-ghaue ny bree (energy crisis: jeeagh er y Fockleyreen ec y jerrey jeh’n pheesh shoh).,The Windscale inquiry is proceding at the present time due to the ‘the crisis of the energies’ (energy crisis: look at the little dictionary at the end of this piece).,
Ta cheeraghyn anchoodit y teihill er jeet dy ve cliaghtey jummal bree erskyn towse.,Exposed countries of the world have become used to wasting energy beyond measure.,
"Ta sleih ayns ny Steatyn Unnaneyssit, syn Europ Heear as cheeraghyn elley lostey ooill, geayl as connaghyn elley goll rish y jouyl hene.","People in the United States, Western Europe, and other countries are burning oil, coal and other fuels like the devil himself. ",
,,
"Ayns y teihll an­choodit, ta shin credjal nish dy vel Jee hene er chur dooin y kiartys[2] dy yummal ooilley yn vree saillin.","In the developed world, we now believe that God himself has given us the right to waste all the power we please.",[2] kiartys] the usual word for ‘a right’ or ‘privilege’ is [cair].
Shen y fa dy row aggle er Europee as Americanee tra ren ny hArabee prios nyn ooill y yrjaghey paart dy vleeantyn er dy henney.,"Therefore, Europeans and Americans were afraid when the Arabs raised the price of their oil some years ago.",
"Roish shen, va cummaltee y teihill an­choodit cliaghtey eeck priosyn feer injil son yn ooill v’ad geddyn veih ny cheeraghyn Arabagh.","Before that, inhabitants of the developed world used to pay very low prices for the oil they were getting from the Arab countries.",
"Dy jarroo, tra dyrjee ny hArabee prios nyn ooill as haink yn pedral y ve goan dy liooar ayns Sostyn as cheeraghyn anchoodit elley, va wheesh aggle as ferg er kuse dy Lunninee as dy row ad soie er obbreeyn-garaashtey tra dooyrt ad roo nagh row pedral ry chionnaghey!","Indeed, when the Arabs raised the price of their oil and petrol became quite scarce in England and other developed countries, a few Londoners were so afraid and angry that they were attacking garage-workers when they said to them that there wasn’t petrol to buy!",
,,
Hoilshee yn aggle as ferg shoh magh dy beagh eh doillee aignaghyn y theay sy teihll anchoodit y chaghlaa.,This fear and anger revealed that it would be difficult to change the minds of the public in the developed world.,
V’ad cliaghtey jummal yn vree as veagh boirey mooar ayn mannagh row yn vree shen ry gheddyn dy haashagh as dy neu-dheyr.,They were used to wasting the power and there would be big trouble unless that power was available easily and cheaply.,
"Ta politickeyryn goaill aggle dy bee anvea mastey yn slieh t’ad dy reill mannagh vees palchey ooill, pedral, geayl as lectraghys ayn.","Politicians are afraid that there will be disquiet among the people they are ruling unless there be enough oil, petrol, coal and electricity.",
Agh she yn irriney nagh bee dy liooar jeh ny reddyn shen ayn my veesmayd jummal ad sy traa ry heet myr ta shin er nyannoo sy traa hie shaghey.,But it is the truth that there won’t be enough of those things if we waste them in the future as we have done in the time gone by.,
Shen y fa dy vel ymmodee sleih treishteil dy beemayd er nyn sauail liorish pooar chesh-veanagh.,That is why many people hope we will be saved by nuclear power.,
"Feed blein er dy hen­ney, va bunnys dy chooilley pheiagh credjal dy darragh pooar veih chesh-vean y vreneen cur dooin ooilley yn vree va shin laccal — as dy beagh shen jeant fegooish monney gaue.","Twenty years ago, almost everyone believed that power from the nucleus of the atom would come to give us all the energy we wanted — and that would be done without much risk.",
"Agh nish, ta ymmodee sleih goaill aggie roish pooar chesh-veanagh: shen y fa dy vel feyshtey Windscale ayn.","But now, many people are afraid of nuclear power” that is why there is a Windscale inquiry.",
Ta mish lane bwooiagh dy vel y feyshtey shoh fo raad.,I am vey pleased that this inquiry is underway.,
Rish traa foddey ta cummaltee ny ellanyn shoh er chredjal bunnys gagh nhee mychione pooar chesh-veanagh ta nyn mainstyryn er ninsh daue.,For a long time residents of these islands have believed almost everything about nuclear power that our masters have told us.,
Red mie t’ayn nagh vel y theay cho arrymagh nish.,It’s a good thing the public aren’t so respectful now.,
Agh cre’n fa dy vel sleih boirit mysh pooar chesh-veanagh?,But why are people troubled about nuclear power?,
Sheeu toiggal yn chooish ny s’diuney.,It is worth understanding the subject deeper.,
,,
"My ta shin geddyn stoo enmyssit urraaniu as jannoo reddyn er-lheh rish, fodmayd feaysley bree veih as t’eh cheet dy ve feer cheh.","If we get material called uranium and do particular things to it, we can release energy from it and it becomes very hot.",
"Lesh y chiass shoh, fodmayd lectraghys y yiennaghtyn.","With this heat, we can generate electricity.",
Foddee dy voddagh oo gra dy vel yn urraaniu (as connaghyn chesh-veanagh elley) goll rish geayl ny ooill my moain.,Maybe you could say that the uranium (and other nuclear fuels) are like coal or oil or peat.,
Ta ooilley ny stooghyn shoh goll er lostey sy choirrey jeh stashoon-pooar lectragh.,All these things are being burned in the furnace of the electric power station.,
"Agh cha nel connaghyn chesh-veanagh kiart gollrish connaghyn elley: t’ad cur magh skellyn gaueagh, as ta ny skellyn cheet dy ve ny s’gauee as yn conney goll er ceau.","But nuclear fuels are not just like other fuels”: they send out dangerous rays, and the rays become more dangerous while the fuel is being spent.",
Ta sleih ennagh credjal dy vod ny skellyn gaueagh ve freilt ayns stoo ennagh dy sauchey son dy bragh (bunnys): ta sleih elley gra nagh vod as dy bee drogh-haghyrt ayn traa en­nagh boayl ennagh.,Some people believe that the dangerous rays can be kept in some safe material for ever (almost) other people say it cannot and that there will be a disaster sometime somewhere.,
Ta mish ayns coardailys rish yn nah heu. My ta reillyn-saucheys screeut sheese (myr t’ad cliaghtey ve) s’mie lesh jeshaghteyryn as sleih elley credjal dy der dy chooilley pheiagh geill da ny reillyn shen.,I am in agreement with the second side. If there are safety rules written down (as there used to be) engineers and other people like to believe that everyine will give heed to those rules.,
Agh ta mee sheiltyn nagh der ad: ta shin ooilley marvanagh as ta shin ooilley jannoo marranyn.,But I suppose that they will not: we are all mortal and we all make mistakes.,
"Ayns cooish shoh y phooar chesh-veanagh ta deiney ennagh shirrey orrin, shin y chredal dy bee stoo skell-vreeoil veih stashoonyn chesh-veanagh freilt dy shickyr son keeadyn dy vleeantyn.",In this matter of nuclear power some men are asking us for us to believe that radioactive material from nulear stations will be kept securely for hundreds of years.,
"Cha gredym, ghooinney. Ayns peeshyn ta ry heet, screeuym mychione fishag chesh-veanagh as shennaghys ny cooish shoh.","I don’t believe, man. In future pieces, I will write about nuclear physics and the history of this subject.",

YN chiaghtyn shoh chaie hie paart dy leih dy cheau kione-shiaghtin ayns Eary Cushlin dy loayrt Gaelg agh er lheh dy yesheenaghey cheu-mooie yn thie aynshen lesh daah[3].,"Last week some people went to spend a weekend in Eary Cushlin to speak Manx, but especially to decorate the outside of the house there with paint.","[3] daah] here used for ‘paint’, for which we would expect [paint], or [peint]."
Hug yn Boayrd-edjaghys cuirrey da’n Cheshaght Ghaelgagh shen y yannoo paart dy hraa er dy henney as ghow ad seose yn cuirrey.,The Board of Education invited Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh to do that some time ago and they took up the invitation.,
"Ren ad goaill toshiaght dy hlaah[4] yn boayl mysh nane-jeig er y chlag moghrey Jesarn, as daah bane dyhimyd[5] ad er ny boallaghyn as geayney er ny uinnagyn as piobyn-surn, as darree ad[6] yn obbyr vie moghrey Jedoonee as foddym gra gyn breagyn y insh dy vel eh jeeaghyn skeoigh as stroamey.","They started to paint the place around eleven o’clock on Saturday morning, and it was a white colour they used on the walls and green on the windows and drainpipes, and they continued the good work on Sunday morning and I can say without telling lies that it looks spruce and grand.","[4] dy lhaah] likely intended to be [dy slaa] ‘to daub, besmear, plaster’ but here meaning ‘to paint’.
[5] dyhimyd] seems to be intended as a past tense of [gymmydey] ‘using’. [gymmydey] began to be used in the late 20thC as an alternative to [gusal], or [jannoo ymmyd jeh].
[6] darree ad] Cregeen mentions that [darree] is used for [darr] ‘last’, so [darree ad] would mean ‘they did last, or endure’. Here it seems to be intended to mean ‘they continued’, for which [chum ad rish] ‘they continued’ might be expected."
"Oie Jesarn ren paart jeu tannaghtyn yn oie aynshen lurg dauesyn cheet back veih’n seshoon ayns y Thie Bouyr; kionfenish va Dai Mac y Eeasteyragh, Phil y Kelly, Juan y Killip (Lwni Manaw), Brian Mac Stoyll, yn Wardoor Paayl Young as mee hene.","On Saturday night some of them stayed the night there after they came back from the session in the ‘Deaf House’ (‘The Central’ pub in Peel), present were Davey Fisher, Phil Kelly, John Killip (Lwni Manaw), Brian Stowell, The Warden Paul Young, and myself.",
"Va Sostnagh ny jees marin rish mysh lieh-oor erreish dooin jeeragh roshtyn[7] yn thie, agh daag ad lurg tammylt.","There was an Englishman or two with us for about half an hour directly after we arrived at the (public) house, but they left after a while.","[7] erreish dooin jeeragh roshtyn]— unattested idiom, the intended meaning seems to be ‘directly after we arrived’, for which we might expect [kiart lurg dooin roshtyn] ‘right after we arrrived’."
Ny yeï[8] shen hie yn wardoor dy lhie.,After that the warden went to bed.,[8] Ny yeï] text; [Ny yeih]
"Va shinyn nyn soie mygeayrt ayns y chamyr-aarlee taggloo ayns Gaelg as giu jough tra mysh lieh-oor lurg jees er y chlag ayns y voghree[9] ren shin clashtyn trap[10] beg er yn uinnag va erskyn yn tubbag sy chamyr-aarlee veg, agh cha dug shin monney geill da agh blakey er y~cheilley rish thullagh.","We we sitting around in the kitchen talking in Manx and drinking booze when at about half-past two in the morning we heard a little tap on the window that was above the sink in the little kitchen, but we didn’t pay much attention to it except to stare at eachother for an instant.","[9] ayns y voghree] text; [er y voghree]
[10] trap] So far unattested elsewhere — evidently ‘tap’.
"
Eisht hie shin er lesh yn choloayrtys ain as lurg minnid ny jees dy doaltattym va feiyr agglagh ayn boayl[11] va’n uinnag as va gless yn uinnag er ny vrishey ayns breneenyn.,"Then we went on with our conversation and after a minute or two, suddenly there was an awful noise where the window was and the glass of the window was broken (shattered) into atoms.","[11] ayn boayl] ‘where’, [ayn] is superfluous here."
"Va shinyn er nyn moostey as gindys c’red ayns niurin va goll er oaie,[12] as haink beggan dy aggie er dy chooilley pheiagh kionfenish.","We were startled and wondering what in hell was going on, and everyone who was present was a little afraid.","[12] goll er oaie] evidently used here to mean [fo raad] ‘underway’, [taghyrt] ‘happening’, or [goll er] ‘going on’."
"Eisht ec yn un traa va dorrys y thie er ny heidey foshlit as roie saihneen dy gheay dy siyragh trooid y thie, as ga dy re 1977 t’ayn as sleih nish gyn credjue y chur da[13] ny bugganeyn as y lheid, va main cooid veg er-creau as jeeaghyn er y cheilley ayns tostid rish shallid fo smooinaght[14] c’red dy yannoo as ny cleayshyn ain er nyn duittym mygeayrt nyn lhieckanyn; as eisht myr dy daink yn un smooinaght rish gagh fer ec yn un traa[15], ghow ad fer lurg fer[16] greim er wappin ennagh — hrog Dai yn skynn-arran, Phil skeab-mooar, mee hene brod-aile, Brian bodeil dy yough, as hie shin dy jeeragh lesh yn dorrys as lhondeyr ec gagh fer jin, as ren shin ronsaghey mygeayrt cheumooie. ","Then, at the same time, the door of the house was blown open and a gust of air ran hastily through the house, and although it is 1977 and people now not believing in bugganes (monsters) and the like, we were somewhat atremble and looking at eachother in silence for a second, thinking what to do and our ears fallen around our cheeks; and then as the same thought occurred to everyone at the same time, one by one they took a hold of wome weapon — Davy picked up the bread knife, Phil a big brush, myself a poker, Brian a bottle of drink, and we went straight towards the door and everyone of us had a lantern, and we searched around outside. ","[13] gyn credjue y chur da] intended meaning seems to be ‘not giving belief to’, the usual expression would be [gyn credjal ayns] ‘not believing in’.
[14] fo smooinaght] unattested elsewhere, [fo] is likely included in error.
[14] fo smooinaght] unattested elsewhere, [fo] is likely included in error.

Hooar shin yn uinnag ny lhie rish y thie as ee brisht as raipit veih ny jeushanyn er egin lesh y gheay.,We found the window lying along the house and it was broken and ripped from the hinges by force by the wind.,
Tra hooar shin magh[17] bun yn chooish shen ren yn angaaish lheie ersooyl voin as va shin abyl dy hayrn ennal reesht.,When we find out the explanation of that story the anguish melted away from us and we were able to draw breath again.,[17] Tra hooar shin magh] ‘When we discovered’ text; [Tra ghow shin magh] ‘When we took out’.
By whaagh eh; un thullagh v’eh mie-chiune[18] eisht va saihnane ayn as brishey yn uinnag as eisht kuinys reesht.,"It was strange; one moment it was very calm, then there was a gust and the breaking of the window and then calm again.",[18] mie-chiune] this seems to be following Irish practice. In Manx we usually would expect [feer chiune]. 
Foddee dy vel ny bugganeyn foast er mayrn ny laghyn shoh.,Maybe bugganes are still around these days.,
