"     Anchasley rish Breagagh, cha row eh orrym dy gholl ersooyl.","     Unlike Breagagh, I didn’t have to go away.",
"Tra va mee my ghuilley aeg, va mee ec scoill ayns Sostyn, er y fa dy row fys ec my ayr nagh beagh obbyr erbee dooys ayns Mannin.","When I was a young boy I was at school in England, because my father knew that there wouldn't be any work for me in the Isle of Man.",
"Er yn oyr shen, va mish as my vraar as my huyraghyn currit ersooyl, as ynsit ry-hoi bea ayns Sostyn as yn Ardreeriaght Ghoal.","For that reason, I and my brother and my sister were sent away, and educated for a life in England and the British Empire.",

S’cooin lhiam eh my dy row eh jea.","After, I became an officer in the Cameronians (it is a regiment that does not exist today) and with them I went to Kenya. I remember it as if it were yesterday.",
"     Hie shin ayns sidoor-vaatey[2] voish Bahrein (raad va shin roie) gys Bombay, ’syn Indjey, as eisht hie shin gys Mombasa.","     We went in a troop ship from Bahrein (where we were previously) to Bombay, in India, and then we went to Mombasa.","[2] sidoor-vaatey] from the word order this seems to be a borrowing from Irish, with the evident meaning ‘troop ship’, for which we might expect, in Manx; [baatey sidooragh], or perhaps [lhong sidooragh], or [saagh sidooragh]."
Ta rah yn ynnyd shen foast ayns my stroanyn. ,The pungent stink of that place is still in my nostrils.,

Va shin troailt fud ny hoie.","     Anyway, we went by train from Mombas to Nairobi where our station was, it is 360 miles from Mombasa to Nairobi, and the majority of the railway is through the National Park called Tsavo, full to the brim with lions and other beasts. We were travelling all night.",

It was nicknamed the “Manchester of East Africa”, because there was a big clothing factory there, and because many English from Lancashire were working in the clothing factory.",[3] thie-greas] — evidently ‘clothing factory’ from [greas] ‘industry in making cloth’.
Ren[4] ny Africkanee ayns y voayl shen loayrt y Vaarle lesh blass Lancashire.,The Africans in that place spoke English with a Lancashire accent.,[4] Ren] — [Va] would be expected here.
