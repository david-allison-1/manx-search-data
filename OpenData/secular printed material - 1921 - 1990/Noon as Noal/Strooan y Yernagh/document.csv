For this phrase we would expect [Va’n çhirveish dy jarroo yindyssagh].

TREISHT SON Y TRAA RY-HEET?,HOPE FOR THE FUTURE?,
LHAIH mee lesh suim yn art liorish Brian Mac Stoyll (Rollage Vanninagh 8.1.77).,     I read with interest the article by Brian Stowell (Manx Star 8.1.77).,
She agglagh eh nagh bee yn nah Cohionnal jeh Studeyryssyn Celtiagh er ny cummal ayns Mannin ’sy vlein 1979.,It is awful that the Conference of Celtic Studies won’t be held in the Isle of Man in 1979.,
S’leayr eh da peiagh erbee dy vel shen er yn oyr nagh vel colaashtey ny ard-scoill erbee ayns Mannin ta bentyn rish studeyryssyn Celtiagh.,It is clear to anyone at all that that is because there isn’t any college or university in the Isle of Man that involves itself with Celtic studies.,
Gyn ourys ta Thie Tashtee jesh ain hannah as ta’n lught ayns shen jannoo obbyr vie da ny cooishyn oc agh cha nel yn argid currit daue liorish yn reiltys dy liooar obbyr er y Ghaelg y yannoo.,"There’s no doubt that we have a fine Museum already and the staff there do a good job for the subjects, but the money given to them by the government is not enough to do work on Manx.",
"     Va aghin er ny chur liorish Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh da’n Chiannoort as Yn Choonseil Sheckteragh shirrey argid Rheynn Ny Gaelgey y chur er bun ’sy steat-hirveish, agh va’n aghin er ny cheau magh.","     A petition was given by The Manx Language Society to the Governor and the Executive Council, asking to establish money for a Department of Manx in the civil service, but the petition was thrown out.",
"Er yn aght cheddin, blein ny ghaa roish yn aghin shen, ren possan dy Vanninee as ollooghyn shirrey argid voish yn reiltys son olloo-schoill ayns Mannin.","In the same way, a year or two before that petition, a group of Manx people and professors asked for money from the government for a university in the Isle of Man",
     Hooar ad cheb jeh cooney voish olloo-scoillyn elley as daarlee ad coontey argidoil va soilshaghey magh nagh beagh feme son tooilley argid voish yn reiltys lurg my ghow yn olloo-coill toshiaght.,     They got an offer of help from other universities and they prepared a financial account that showed that there wouldn’t be any need for more money from the government after the university began.,
"Va’n eie oc dy voddagh yn Mannishter ve yn olloo-scoill as oddagh ny studeyryn cummal ayns thieyn-aaght er shooylaghyn Ghoolish ’sy gheurey, agh myr ta fys eu, va’n eie oc er ny arganey liorish Tinvaal as v’eh ceaut magh.","Their idea was that the Nunnery could be the university and the students would live in hotels on Douglas Promenade in the winter, but as you know, their idea was debated by Tynwald and it was thrown out, ",
"Er lhiams dy row eh currit magh, cha nee er y fa dy beign da Tinvaal cur argid da’n olloo-scoill, agh er y fa dy beagh ram studeyryn (lesh fuilt liauyrey!) as eieyn Soshalagh oc ayns Mannin!","I think it was thrown out not because Tynwald would have to give money to the university, but because there would be a lot of students (with long hair!) with Socialist ideas in the Isle of Man!",
Veagh ny studeyryn briaght feyshtyn mychione y reiltys as cur tooilley ourssyn da ny Manninee mychione Tinvaal as yn veeroose echey er kiartyn shibbaltagh.[3],The students would be asking questions about the government and giving more suspicions to the Manx concerning Tynwald and its negligence of civil rights.,"[3] kiartyn shibbaltagh] ‘civil rights’ — seems to be a Manxification of the Irish for ‘civil rights’; [cearta sibhialta]. In Classical Manx a ‘right’ in this context is [cairys]. In the Acts of Tynwald of the early twenieth century, ‘civil’ is usually translated as [theayagh]. "
     S’leayr eh nagh dug Tinvaal v’ayn geill erbee da kiartyn y phobble as cultoor dooghyssagh Vannin er y fa dy row eh cha “cheu-ree”.,     How clear it is that the Tynwald at that time did not pay attention to the rights and native cuture of the people of the Isle of Man because it was so “right wing”.,
S’feer eh dy row Tinvaal yn reiltys ny smoo “cheu-ree” (Tory) ayns yn Europey er lhimmey jeh reiltys ny Spaainey.,It is true that Tynwald was the most “right wing” (Tory) government in Europe except for the government of Spain.,
"Myr sampleyr elley, cha nod Manninagh erbee geddyn cooney leighoil erbee son cooish shibbaltagh (civil) ayns quaiyl Vannin.","As another example, no Manxman can get any legal aid for a civil case in a Manx court.",
Row aggle er Tinvaal dy beagh ad ceau yn argid ersooyl er reddyn nagh b’eeu?,Was Tynwald afraid that they would be throwing money away on something that wasn’t worth it?,
"Er lhiam pene, agh, cha nodmayd jannoo briwnys er feeuid dagh ooilley red lesh stundayrtyn argidoil.","I think myself, but, we cannot judge the value of everything with financial standards.",
"Ta argid dy liooar ec yn reiltys nish dy chur meer da Rheynn Ny Gaelgey, as foddee, dys ard-scoill veg cour studeyrys Celtiagh.","The government has enough money now to give a bit to a Department of Manx, and maybe, to a small university for Celtic studies. ",
"     S’quaagh eh dy vel Yn Ellan goaill moyrn nagh vel ee ayrn jeh Sostyn, er y fa dy vel cultoor as leigh er-lheh eck, as cha nel ee cummal seose yn cultoor eck!","     How strange it is that the Island is proud that it isn’t part of England, because it was separate culture and law, and it doesn’t support its culture!",
S’treisht lhiam dy bee’n Tinvaal noa kiartaghey shen!,I hope the new Tynwald will correct that!,
"     Fockle elley, roish my derrym jerrey er yn skeeal shoh.","     Another word, before I finish this story.",
Bee shiu er vakin ayns ny pabyryn naight dy vel yn reiltys son cur ersooyl da dagh ooilley phaitchey syn Ellan cooiney argid son yn wheiggoo bleeaney as feed jeh Benrein Hostyn.,You will have seen in the newspapers that the government can give away to every child in the Island a silver coin for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Queen of England.,
"Myrgeddin, bee Barrantee ny baljyn as skeeraghyn fud ny h-Ellan cur ersooyl cappanyn son y chooish cheddin.","Also, the Commissioners of the towns and parishes throughout the Island will be giving away cups for the same thing.",
Cre’n fa nagh vel ny focklyn “Lord of Mann” er ny screeu er ny cappanyn chammah as ny focklyn “Benrein”?,Why aren’t the words “Lord of Man” written on the cups as well as the word(s) “Queen?”,
Erskyn ourys cha vel feme erbee son y lheid ayns Mannin.,"Undoubtedly, there is no need at all for such a thing in the Isle of Man.",
"Ren yn Tinval v’ayn roie reaghey ny giootyn shen, as s’treisht mooar lhiam nagh bee yn quaiyl t’ayn nish cha ommidjagh car ny queig bleeaney ry-heet!","The previous Tynwald arranged those gifts, and I greatly hope that the current (Tynwald) court isn’t so foolish during the five years to come!",

"Agh ta “Breagagh” ny poblaghteyr, dy mie er enn da ny meoiryn-shee as y lhied son ny barelyn echey!","But “breagagh” is a republican, well known to the police and the like for his opinions!",
"Cre ta shiuish, lhaihderyn smooinaghtyn?",What do you readers think?,
Dy beagh lieh jeh’n argid vees ceaut ec yn reiltys ain er y voghtynid shen currit da cooish ny Gaelgey veagh cooish ny Gaelgey dy bollagh er ny chaghlaa as er ny niartaghey!,If half of the money that will be spent by our government on that nonsense were to be given to the matter of the Manx Language then the subject of the Manx Language would be completely changed and strengthened!,
Strooan Y Yernagh,Strooan Y Yernagh (‘The Irishman’s Stream’),
"     Ta’n strooan shoh heose erskyn Colby Mooar, as ta shoh yn aght dy dooar eh yn ennym echey.","     This stream is up above Greater Colby, and this is the way that it got its name.",
"Va shenn dooinney as shenn ven heose ayns shen as haink fer ny dhieyn yn oie shen as she Yernagh v’eh, as hug ad bee da as hug ad magh eh dy lhie ’sy veechagh as va towl ’sy veechagh as oddagh y Yernagh clashtyn ooilley ny va goll er ’sy thie mooar hene.","There was an old man and an old woman up there and a ‘fellow of the houses’ (beggar) came that night and he was an Irishman, and they gave him food and they put him out to bed in the beggar house and there was a hole in the beggar house and the Irishman could hear all that was going on in the big house itself.",
"     Dooyrt y shenn Vanninagh rish y ven echey, “Shegin dooin marroo y Yernagh ’sy voghrey.” (Va shenn vohlt oc enmyssit “Yn Yernagh”.","     The old Manx woman said to the other woman, “We (will) have to kill ‘The Irishman’ in the morning.” (They had an old mutton sheep called ‘The Irishman’.",
"Cha row yn shenn phiyr agh laccal dy chur tooilley bee da’n fer joarree, agh, shee bannee mee!","The old pair were only wanting to give more food to the stranger, but oh my god!",
Va Gailck Yernagh ec fer ny dhieyn as hoig eh dagh ooilley ’ockle jeh’n Vanninish!,The beggar knew Irish and he understood every word of the Manx!,
"Tra v’eh anmagh er yn oie, dirree eh ass e lhiabbee as daag eh y beechagh lane d’aggle, as hooar y shenn chubbyl eh ’sy voghrey, baiht ’sy trooan v’eh, as voish yn traa shen magh ta shen yn ennym t’er ve er y trooan.","When it was late at night, he got up out of his bed and he left the beggar house full of fear, and the old couple found him in the morning, he was drowned in the stream, and from that time on that is the name that that has been the name of the stream.",

"Ansherbee, shen ren eh as hie eh stiagh ayns ny sidooryn kiangit (regular soldiers).","Anyway, that’s what he did and he went into (joined) the regular soldiers.",
     As va blein lurg blein goll shaghey as cha row ad geddyn naight erbee jeh.,     And year after year was passed and they didn’t get any news of him.,
"Er lhiam nagh row sleih son screeu monney ayns ny laghyn shen, ansherbee, cha dooar ad fockle erbee voish.","I think that people didn’t write much in those days, anyway, they didn’t get any word from him.",
"Loayr ad mychione echey dy mennick as va’n shenn ven dreamal mychione echey dy mennick neesht, as v’ee cliaghtey ve boirit dy mooar.","They spoke about him often and the old woman was often dreaming about him too, and she used to be very worried.",

"     As hie eh ansherbee, as haink eh dy Ghoolish.","     And he went on anyway, and he came to Douglas.",
"She er chosh va’n sleih jannoo nyn yurnaaghyn ayns ny laghyn shen, cha row aght erbee elley dy gheddyn mygeayrt yn ellan, agh hie eh roish.","It was on foot that people made their journies in those days, there was no other way to get around the island, but he went.",

"As hie eh stiagh, as ghow ad toshiaght dy loayrt as vrie ad jeh mychione ny naightyn echey as haghyr eh dy row shoh thie e huyr hene!","And he went in, and they started to talk and they asked him about his news and it happened that this was his own sister’s house!",

As va boggey mooar ersyn[4] dy chlashtyn dy row yn ayr as y voir echey foast bio.,And there ‘was great joy on him’ to hear tha his father and mother were still alive.,[4] va boggey mooar ersyn] ‘there was great joy upon him’. The expected idiom here would be [ghow eh boggey mooar] ‘he greatly rejoiced’.
Cha dod y voghrey cheet tappee dy liooar.,The morning couldn’t come fast enough.,
"Ansherbee, cha lheah’s haink keeiraght y vadran, dooyrt eh, “Ta mee ersooyl nish myr ta, dy chur shilley er y shenn sleih, as hig oo hene noal mairagh as cluinnee oo cre’n aght hie eh lhien.”","Anyway, as soon as the (darkness of the) dawn came, he said, “I am away now then, to see the old people and you yourself will come tomorrow and you’ll hear how it went with us.”",

"     As haink eh neose, ansherbee, as va’n shenn ven mooie ayns shen, beeaghey ny kiarkyn, as yn shenn dooinney neesht, v’eshyn ny hassoo ’sy dorrys jeeaghyn mygeayrt, as hie eh noon as denee eh jeu oddagh eh cur stiagh yn oie maroo,","     And he came down, anyway, and the old woman was outside there, feeding the hens, and the old man too, he was standing in the doorway looking around, and he went over and he asked them if he could stay the night with them,",
"as cha row fys oc quoi’n dooinney stoamey v’ayn as coamrey jesh er, as dooyrt ad rish y cheilley dy follit nagh row eh ass y voayl shen ansherbee, as dooyrt ad rishyn dy beagh eh kiart dy liooar dy heet stiagh as dy chur stiagh yn oie maroo ’sy thie oc.","and they didn’t know who the handsome man with nice clothing on him was, and they said to eachother secrectly that he wasn’t from that place anyway, and they said to him that it would be right enough (ok) to come in and spend the night with them in their house.",
"As shen myr v’eh, as hie eh stiagh, as cha dooyrt eh veg mychione quoi v’eh, ny red erbee.","And that is how it was, and he went in, and he didn’t say anything about who he was, or anything.",

V’ee laccal dy gheddyn yn argid echey.,She wanted to get his money.,

 “Haink mee dy akin dug shiu enney er ny dyn. Haink eh lesh shilley orrym laa jea tra v’eh er e raad thie.”, “I came to see if you recognised him or not. He came to see me in the day yesterday when he was on his way home.”,

"T’eh jeeaghyn nagh vel “Cronk Yn Angaaish” yn ennym cairagh jeh, agh “Cronk M’angaaish”.","It seems that “Cronk Yn Angaaish” (‘The Hill of Anguish”) isn’t its proper name, but “Cronk M’Angaaish” (“The Hill of My Anguish”).",
