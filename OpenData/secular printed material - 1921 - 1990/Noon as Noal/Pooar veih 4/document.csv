     Cha row fys aym roie dy vel fockley-magh yn ockle “diuney” doon-ya as cha nee jioon-a.,     I didn’t know before that the pronunciation of the word “diuney” is doon-ya and not jioon-a.,
"Cha geayll mee rieau loayrtagh ny Gaelgey gra “doon-ya” son “deeper”, agh rere Adrian as Robard y Comish, ta shin ooilley er ve fockley magh y fockle er aght aggairagh rish bleeantyn!","I have never heard a speaker of Manx say “doon-ya” for “deeper”, but according to Adrian and Robert Thomson, we have all been pronouncing the word wrongly for years!",
"Agh cre mysh “diun” — deepen, vn. Diunaghey, as cre mysh diunid n.m. depth?","But how about “diun” — deepen, vn. Diunaghey, and what about diunid n.m. depth?",
"Lhisagh ad goll er screeu myr “duinid”, “duinaghey”?","Should they be written like “duinid”, “duinaghey”?",
Cheayll mee y fockle “dowin” dy mennick voish ny loayrtee dooghyssagh agh cha geayll mee rieau “diuney” voish ny beill oc.,I heard the word “dowin” often from the native speakers but I never heard “diuney” from their mouths.,
Foddee dy vel fys ec Leslie ny Illiam ny Chalse ny Markys er y fockley-magh kiart. Cre mysh gheiney?,"Maybe Leslie (Quirk), or William (Bill Radcliffe), or Charles (Craine), or Mark (Braide) knows about the correct pronunciation?",
"Jeh un red ta mee slane shickyr, ta rour fys er y ghlare cur lhiettrimys mooar er peiagh erbee tra t’eh laccal dy loayrt y Ghaelg dy flaaoil!","Of one thing I am completely sure, too much knowledge of the language puts a great hinderance on anyone when he wants to speak Manx fluently!",
Nagh dinsh Conradh Na Gaeilge dooin tra cheayll ad mychione aa-vioghey ny Gaelgey ayns Mannin — “Bee-jee er nyn dwoaie noi ny scoillaryn — ver ad mow yn chengey loayrit!”,Did Conradh Na Gaeilge not tell us when they heard about the revival of Manx in the Isle of Man — “Be on guard against scholars — they will destroy the spoken language!”,
"Ta’n cheisht shoh feer chramp neesht.

We cannot do without help and adice from such as Robert and we are in great debt to him and to other scholars because  ... all their help, but the language must be spoken.",
"Nagh dooyrt Ned as e henn chaarjyn, “Freill ee bio,” as nagh ren shinyn gialdyn shen y yannoo?","Didn’t Ned and his old friends say “Keep it alive,” and didn’t we promise to do that?",
Tra ta mee loayrt Gaelg rish Adrian nish ta aggle orrym my veeal y osley!,When I speak Manx to Adrian I am afraid to open my mouth!,
     Er hoh screeuyn suimoil honnick mee er y chiaghtin ’syn earishlioar “Woman” as t’eh soiaghey beg jeh[1] ny glaraghyn Celtiagh.,     Here is an interesting letter I saw in the week in the magazine ‘Woman’ and it belittles the Celtic languages.,[1] soiaghey beg jeh] text; [soilshaghey beg jeh]
Cha nel y “Cultural Imperialism” oc geddyn baase marish yn “Empire” oc er chor erbee!,Their ‘Cultural Imperialism’ isn’t dying with their Empire at all!,
"     We have just returned from a lovely holiday in Wales — lambs, castles, mountains and pony trekking. The only discordant note was the obsession with the Welsh Language. I don’t mean the traditional Celtic, the long unpronounceable place names that we’ve always loved and never quite understood; but the phoney contrived Welsh — Cas bspectol for spectacle case and parc carafanserau for caravan site.",,
"     Now all road signs are written, at enormous expense, in two languages and yobs with black aerosol sprays have systematically covered up the English words, this could be dangerous. Do you know Perygyl means Danger, and Heddiu means Police? Need a loo? Find a sign saying Merchad or even Cyfleusterau Cyhoeddus! A quiet country walk can be hazardous if you find our (too late) that Gwylier y Tarw means Beware of the Bull. There sems to be no opposition to French words like Cafe or to certain English phrases like Bed and Breakfast, Keep Out or Support Our Charity Generously.", ,
"     Is it true that Welsh school-children are being taught Welsh first and English second, instead of visa-versa? If so they will be enormously disadvantaged educationally, as is now being proved by recent examination failure in English Language. Have we seen the last of the Dylan Thomases and Richard Burtons who brought magic to the English Language? I hope some new Llewellyn will soon arise to free Wales from this growing restriction.",,
     It is encouraging to know that there are apparently no phone contrived words in English. What does “phoney” mean?,,
     S’quaagh eh yn aght ta ny Sostynee cur dwoaie da chengey erbee elley er lhimmey jeh’n Vaarle ennoil ocsyn! Er hoh meer elley:—,    It’s strange the way the English hate any other language except for their beloved English! Here is another bit:—,
HIGHLAND HOSPITALITY,,
"     When beginning to descend the hill towards Lock Lomond we overtook two girls, who told us we could not cross the ferry till evening, for the boat was gone with a number of people to Church. One of the girls was exceedingly beautiful; and the figures of both of them, in grey plaids falling to their feet, their faces only being uncovered, excited our attention before we spoke to them; but they answered us so sweetly that we were quite delighted. At the same time they stared at us with an innocent look of wonder. I think I never heard the English language sound more sweetly than from the mouth of the elder of these girls, while she stood at the gate answering our inquiries, her face flushed with the rain; her pronunciation was clear and distinct, without difficulty, yet slow, like that of foreign speech.",,
"     They were both exceedingly desirous to get me what I wanted to make me comfortable. I was to have a gown and petticoat of the mistress’s so they turned out the whole wardrobe upon the parlour floor, talking Erse to one another and laughing all the time. It was long before they could decide which of the gowns I was to have; they chose at last, no doubt thinking it was the best, a light-coloured sprigged cotton, with long sleeves, and they both laughed when I was putting it on, with the blue linsey petticoat; and one or the other, or both together, helped me dress, repeating at least half a dozen times, “You never had on the like of that before.” They held a consultation of several minutes over a pair of coarse woollen stockings, gabbling Erse as fast as their tongues could move. ",,

     Cheayll mee Manninagh (Dooie?) gimraa yn traa hie eh stiagh ayns thie oast raad va ny Gaelgeyryn cummal Oie Ghailckagh.,     I heard a Manxman mention the time he went into a pub where the Manx speakers were holding a Manx-speaking evening.,
 “They are all jabbering away in Manx” as eshyn. , “They are all jabbering away in Manx” he said.,
It is strange the way one speaks English but gabbles or jabbers away in any other language!,,
POOAR VEIH CHESHVEAN Y VRENEEN,POWER FROM THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM,
Ta fys ain ooilley dy lhieg ny Americanee daa vleaystan chesh-veanagh er ny Shapaanee ayns 1945.,We all know that the Americans dropped two nuclear bombs on the Japanese in 1945.,

"Tra ta chesh-vean urraaniu goll er scoltey, she naeeraneyn tappee ta cheet magh ass y scoltey.","When a uranium nucleus is split, it is fast neutrons that come out of the split. ",
"Agh ayns urraaniu dooghyssagh, cha vod naeeraneyn tappee cur aa-vuilley-driaght fo raad.","But in natural uranium, fast neutrons could not get a chain-reaction started.",

"
"Myr screeu mee roie, ta urraaniu dooghyssagh jeant jeh daa horch dy urraaniu —U-235 as U238. ","As I wrote before, natural uranium is made of two types of uranium — U-235 and U-238. ",

"Son y chooid smoo, ta U-235 foddey ny smoo ymmydoil na U-238.","For the most part, U-235 is far more useful that U-238.",
"Agh ta feer veggan dy U-235 ayns urraaniu dooghyssagh, as t’eh costal argid mooar yn daa horch y scarrey veih my cheilley.","But there is very little U-235 in natural uranium, and it costs big money to separate the two types from each other.",

Er nonney oddagh ad scarrey U-235 veih U-238 as jannoo bleaystan ass U-235.,"Otherwise, they could separate U-235 from U-238 and make bombs out of U-235.",
