Ta Robard  gynsaghey Gaelg dy mie nish as cha nel eh jannoo monney marranyn edyr!,Robard is learning Manx well now and he isn’t making many errors at all!,,
Ta Robard ny ghooinney mooinjerey aym pene er y fa dy daink ny shenn ayraghyn echey voish Skeerey Andreays as va Karagher yn ennym orroo.,Robert is a relative of mine because his ancestors came from Andreas Parish and their name was Fargher.,,

V’ad ny lhie ayns kishtey fuygh eddrym fegooish farkyl ny coodagh erbee er lhimmey son joan chiu.,They were lying in a light wooden (balsa wood?) box without a lid or any cover except for thick dust.,,
Va kiare as feed jeu.,There were twenty-four of them.,,
"Ass yn earroo shoh va jees dy bollagh brisht, jees elley va scrabit ass myghin as ga dy row shin abyl dy chlashtyn rish feed jeh ny rhollanyn er y greie va eeassit dooin ec y voayl chemmyrk, va ny sheeanyn feer faase ec keayrtyn.","Out of this number two were completey broken, two others were scratched mercilessly and although we were able to hear twenty of the cylinders on the machine that was lent to us at the place of refuge (safe place), the sounds were very weak at times.",,
Cheau shin slane laa geaishtagh rish ny rhollanyn as screeu rolley soiaghey magh cre va recortyssit er dagh rhollan.,We spent a whole day listening to the cylinders and writing a list setting out what was recorded on each cylinder.,,
"Va shoh stoyr yindyssagh jeh Gaelg myr v’ee goll er loayrt ayns Cregneash ’sy vlein 1930 ny 1931 agh aless, cha nel pyagh erbee er chlashtyn ny rhollanyn er lhimmey son Illiam as meehene as strooys lhiam dy vel ooilley yn obbyr jeant ec Marstrander bentyn rish recortyssyn er ve ayns fardail, son ta mee er chlastyn voish y Vuseum nagh vod ad geddyn sheean erbee nish ass ny rhollanyn.","This was a wonderful treasure of Manx as it was being spoken in Cregneash in the year 1930 or 1931, but unfortunately, no one has heard the cylinders except for Illiam and myself and it seems to me that all the work done by Marstrander concerning recordings was in vain, because I have heard from the Museum that they cannot get any sound out the cylinders now.",,
Va Harry coontey eh dy ve jurnaa liauyr eddyr Doolish as Cregneash as roish va kied aym dy aagail e hie as goll roym va mee eginit dy ooraghey as niartaghey my-hene lesh lhongey.,"Harry was considering it to be a long journey between Douglas and Cregneash and before I would be permitted to leave his house and go, I was made to refresh and strengthen myself with a meal.",,
"Shen y fa va cappan dy hey, arran as eeym as ooh thunnag broiet currit kiongoyrt rhym.","Therefore, a cup of tea, bread and butter and a boiled duck egg was put before me.",,
Er-lhiam dy row oohyn thunnag gyn earroo ec Harry as va dwoaie ayms orroo.,"I think Harry had too many duck eggs to count, and I hated them.",,
V’ad ro lajer er my hon as cha dod mee ee nane.,They were too strong for me and I couldn’t eat one.,,
"Hie yn ayrn smoo jeu ayns my vussal, as eisht dys my phoggaid dy ve tilgit ersooyl er y raad thie.","Most of them went in my handkerchief, and then to my pocket to be thrown away on the way home.",,

Smooinee mee keayrt dy chur lesh tombagey[4] myr cowrey chooilleeney[5] son e chenjallys dou.,"Once, I thought to bring tobacco, as a token of appreciation for his kindness to me.","[4] thombagey] this word does not appear in the original piece, but evidently it, or a something similar, has been ommitted in error.
[5] cowrey chooilleeney] ‘a sign of compensation’ here taken to mean ‘a token of appreciation’ (although other translations might be preferred). [cowrey] is usually treated as a masculine noun, so [cowrey cooilleeney] would be expected.",
Cha row eh goaill tayrn dy mennick agh heill mee dy beagh “Cabbyl Caggee” tombaghey cooie er e hon.,"He wasn’t taking a draw often, but I supposed that ‘War Horse’ would be a suitable tobacco for him.",,
Va’n jishag aym kionnaghey yn stoo shoh as va fys ayms dy row eh stoo lajer as niartal.,My dad bought this stuff and I knew that it was strong and mighty stuff.,,
Choud’s ta cooinaghtyn ayms cha row Harry jannoo ymmyd jeh’n tombaagey shoh ga va soiaghey jeant echey jeh.,"As far as I remember Harry wasn’t using this tobacco, although he accepted it.",,
Cha naik mee rieau eh giarrey yn wed son y piob.,I never saw him cut the wad for the pipe.,,
"Bare lesh eh stoo gollrish shenn teid[6], cassit as thummit ayns therr v’eh freayll ayns duinid e phoggaid.","He preferred suff like an old rope, twisted and dipped in tar, that he was keeping in the depths of his pocket.","[6] teid] ‘a rope’, the most common spelling in Classical Manx is [tedd], with variants [tead] and [teidd] found in later Manx.",
"Cha row rieau monney jaagh cheet ass y piob as cha s’ayms mannagh ghow eh taitnys ass ny dyn, agh va’n tombaghey shen jioogh atchimagh er foaddanyn!","There was never much smoke coming out of the pipe and I don’t know if he enjoyed the pipe or not, but that tobacco was terribly ‘greedy for matches’.",,
Ta shen cur er-ash dou skeeal aitt.,That reminds me of a funny story.,,
"Laa dy row dooyrt Harry rhym, “Vel fys ayds dy row yn chied er dy etlagh ayns Ellan Vannin dooinney ayns Cregneash?”","One day Harry saif to me, “Do you know that the first man to fly in the Isle of Man was a man in Cregneash?”",,
"     Va thanvaneys vooar orrym. “Dy jarroo, cha geayll mee shen — insh dou yn skeeal my sailliu.”",     I was greatly astonished. “Really? I’ve never heard that — tell me the story please.”,,
     “Illiam Collister va’n ennym echey. V’eh faagail yn ven echey as getlagh dys Nherin dy ve ny hushtallagh.”  ,     “His name was William Collister. He was leaving his wife and flying to Ireland to be an evangelist.”,,
"Er hoh scuirr eh, as ghow eh toshiaght dy chur aile ’sy phiob as va mish farkaght er dy meen.","With this he stopped, and he started to put fire in the pipe and I was waiting patiently for him.",,
"Shoh jeant, hie eh er, “Va red jeant echey ass daa dollan er e gheayltin, hass eh er mullagh boalley y muclagh as dooyrt eh rish e ven, ‘Lesh cooney Yee neems oo faagail,’ as lheim eh seose ’syn aer.","This done, he went on, “He had made a thing out of two dollans (a hoop with a sheepskin spread over it / a tray / a drum) on his shoulders, he stood on the top of the pig-sty wall and he said to his wife, “With God’s help, I will leave you,” and he jumped up in the air.",,
     Ec y traa shoh va’n piob bunnys mooghit as va Harry tayrn er lesh ooilley e niart as bwoailley foaddan lurg foaddan.,     At the time the pipe was almost out and Harry was drawing on it with all his might and striking match after match.,,
"     Reesht va mee farkaght dy chlashtyn jerrey yn skeeal as hooar yn miandid ayms y varriaght as vrie mee, “Cre haink er eisht?”","     Again, I was waiting to hear the end of the story and my eagerness got the better of me and I asked, “What happened to him then?”",,
"     Fy yerrey, tra va’n piob lostey dy mie dooyrt Harry, “Ren y ven echey reuyrey eh magh ass y thorran lesh grape.”","     Finally, when the pipe was burning well, Harry said, “His wife dug him out of the dungheap with a dung-fork.”",,
Shimmey keayrt ta mee er ghearey er y skeeal shen as yn aght ve inshit dou. ,Many’s the time I have laught at that story and way he told it to me.,,
Ga nagh row eh bannit lesh cooid heihllt[7] cre erbee v’echey v’eh booiagh dy rheynn rish pyagh erbee.[8],"Although he wasn’t blessed with worldly goods, whatever he had he was pleased to share with anyone. ","[7] cooid heihllt] ‘worldy goods’. The usual spelling is [cooid heiihlt]. [cooid seihlt] is also well attested.
[8] rheynn rish pyagh erbee] ‘to divide to anyone’ — evidently intended to translate the English phrase ‘to share with’, for which we would expect something like [dy rheynn mastey sleih] ‘to divide (share) among people’ or [cur ayrn da peiagh erbee] — ‘give a share to anyone’.",
