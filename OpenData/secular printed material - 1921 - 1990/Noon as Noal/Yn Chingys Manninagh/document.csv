Yn Chingys Manninagh,The Manx Disease,

Ta ny Sostynee genmys eh “Yn Chingys Goaldagh”.,The English call it “The British Disease”.,
Dy dooghyssagh cha jean ad goaill rish yn ennym ta ny mooarheeree cur orroo!,"Naturally, they won’t accept the name the continentals give them!",
Ayns shoh ayns Ellan Vannin ta “Chingys Manninagh” ayn.,Here in the Isle of Man there is a “Manx Disease”.,
"T’eh er ve ny lhie dy trome orrin ec y chooid sloo neayr’s 1872, tra hie “Yn Slattys Son Ynsagh Mie” ny hrooid[1] yn ardwhaiyl ain.","It has been lying heavily upon us since 1872, when the “Act for Good Education” went through our parliament. ",[1] ny hrooid] ‘through it’ — this is sometimes found in the Manx of the 1970s where [trooid] ’through’ would be expected.
     Rere yn slattys shoh (enmyssit ’sy Vaarle — The General Education Act) va dagh ooilley nhee ayns scoillyn Ellan Vannin dy ve jeant ass y Vaarle as va’n Ghaelg dy ve sthampit fo chosh cha tappee as oddagh ee.,     According to this act (called in English — The Good Education Act) everything in the schools of the Isle of Man was to be done in English and Manx was to be stamped underfoot as fast and it could (be).,
"Ren ny mainshteryn scoill ‘job mie’ jeh neesht, ren ad cha mie dy jarroo dy row yn Ghaelg bunnys marroo tra hie mish dy scoill ayns 1931.","The school master did a ‘good job’ of it too, they did so well indeed that Manx was almost dead when I went to school in 1931.",
"Voish y vlein shen dys y vlein dy daag mee yn scoill, 1943, cha geayll mee un ’ockle j’ee.","From that year until the year I left school, 1943, I didn’t hear one word of it.",
"Dy jarroo, cha row fys aym bunnys dy row yn lhied ayn, agh son shen va mee er chlashtyn my Yishig Vooar taggloo."," Indeed, I almost didn’t know that there was such a thing, except for that which I had heard my grandfather speak.",
"     Myr ta fys ec ymmodee Manninee dooie, hug yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh docamaid (document) liauyr da’n Chiannoort as Yn Choonseil Shecktaragh nurree, mychione cur er bun Rheynn beg ny Gaelgey ’sy staait-hirveish ayns Mannin.","     As many native Manx people know, the Manx Language Society gave a long document to the Governor and the Executive Council last year, about establishing a little department of Manx in the civil service in the Isle of Man.",
Haink yn eie shoh gys neunhee er y fa ren y Choonseil shaghney y currym eck as hug ny “shauneenyn” shen coyrle dooin dy chur lhien y chooish gys Boayrd Ynsee Ellan Vannin.,This idea came to nothing because the Council shunned their duty and those ‘Jackeens’ advised us to bring the case to the Isle of Man Board of Education.,
" Ren shin shen as, myr yiarragh yn shenn sleih, “Hie shin dys thie y ghoair dy hirrey ollan,” as cha dooar shin veg agh neuhuim.","We did that, and, as the old people would say, “We went to the goat’s house looking for wool,” and we got nothing but disinterest. ",
"     Er hoh diu, heese, eie elley, ayns art er ny screeu liorish nyn garrey veen Brian Mac Stoyll.","     Here for you (I present for you), another idea, in an article written by our dear friend Brian Stowell.",
" ’Syn art heese, ta Brian ginsh dooin mychione yn aght ta nyn heshey-Cheltiee, ny Cornee, cur nearey er ny Manninee boghtey, ga dy dooar yn chengey ocsyn baase dy bollagh ymmodee bleeantyn er dy henney.","In the article below, Brian tells us about the way our Celtic partners the Cornish, shame the poor Manx, even though their language died completely many years ago. ",
"Ayns Mannin, raad nagh dooar chengey ny mayrey baase er chor erbee, cha nel cooney oikoil foast ry-gheddyn da’n ghlare.","In Mann, where the mother-tongue (Manx language) did not die at all, there is no official assistance yet available for the language.",
"As was once written, there is indeed “a great sickness in the Manx soul”. If only as much money would accrue to the Manx Treasury as that which it obtains from the sale of coins and special stamp issues, what a stampede there would be to climb on the band wagon! Some of the politicians would become ‘gaelgeyryn’ overnight!",,
UNDINAGHT STUDEYRYS MANNINAGH?,An Institute of Manx Studies?,
,,
"BEE Y SHEYOO Cohionnal Eddyrashoonagh jeh Studeyrys Celtiagh cummit ayns 1979 ayns Gaillimh, Nerin. ","THE SIXTH Internation Conference of Celtic Studies will be held in 1979 in Galway, Ireland. ",
Cha bee y cohionnal scanshoil shoh cummit ayns Mannin ayns 1979:,This important conference won’t be held in the Isle of Man in 1979:,
Lhisagh shoh cur imnea er Manninee as lhisagh eh greinnaghey sleih dy chur er bun undinaght ennagh cour ard-ynsaght ayns Mannin.,This should be of concern to the Manx and it should encourage people to establish some foundation for higher education in the Isle of Man.,

"Ayns 1953, 1967, 1971, as 1975, va cohionnallyn cummit ayns Cardydd, Dun Edin, Rennes as Pensance.","In 1953, 1967, 1971, and 1975, the conferences were held in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Rennes and Penzance.",
"Rere yn oardagh, lhisagh y sheyoo cohionnal ve cummit ayns Mannin, y cheyoo cheer Cheltiagh.","In order, the sixth conference should be held in the Isle of Man, the sixth Celtic country.",
"Agh y ving, ad hoc ta reaghey craad vees y cohionnal cummit, s’liklee dy ren ish shaghney Mannin son 1979 er y fa nagh vel undinaght erbee ayns shen oddagh reaghey y cohionnal dy cummeydagh.","But the ad hoc committee, those of them that arrange where the conference will be held, it’s highly likely that they avoided the Isle of Man for 1979 because there isn’t any foundation at all there that could arrange the conference competently.",
"T’eh bunnys shickyr nagh beagh cohionnal 1975 er ve cummit ayns Penzance gyn Undinaght Studeyrys Cornagh y ve ayn neayrs 1971 ayns Redruth, y Corn.","It is almost certain that there wouldn’t have been held in Penzance without the Cornish Studies Foundation existing since 1971 in Redruth, Cornwall.",
"Myr shen, ta Mannin tannaght feer voal ayns Studeyrys Celtiagh, myr t’ee ayns cooishyn ynsee elley.","So, Mannin remains very poor in Celtic Studies, as it is in other educational matters.",
       She cohionnal scanshoil y Cohionnal Eddyrashoonagh jeh Studeyrys Celtiagh. T’eh tayrn scoillaryn jeh goo mie voish ymmoddee cheeraghyn.,     The International Conference of Celtic Studies is a very important conference. He attracts scholars of good reputation from many countries.,
"Ayns Penzance myleeaney va chaghteryn ayn voish ny Steatyn Unnaneyssit, yn Ungaar, yn Idaal, y Rank, y Velg, y Ghiarmaan, y Spaainney, Scandinavia chammah as adsyn voish Sostyn as ny cheeraghyn Celtiagh.","In Penzance this year there were representatives from the United States, Hungary, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Scandinavia, as well as those from England and the Celtic lands.",
Va’n Corn goltaghey mysh daa cheead chaghter as hug shen cooney as cree da’n Chorn hene.,Cornwall was welcoming about two hundred representatives and that aided and encouraged Cornwall itself.,
Dod lheid y chohionnal shoh skeayley magh fys dy mie.,Such a conference was able to disseminate knowledge well.,
"Va shoh baghtal ry akin er y fa dy dooar y mob beg dy Vanninee oardee son stoo bentyn rish y Ghaelg voish ollooscoillyn as scoillaryn ayns Paris, y Raue, Bonn, Stutgart, Uppsala, Ghent as Divlyn (haghyr shoh lesh feer veggan dy hoilsheydys as fegooish taishbynys-lioar kiart).","This was clear to see because the little gang of Manx people got orders for material concerning Manx from universities and academics in Paris, Rome, Bonn, Stuttgart, Uppsala, Ghent and Dublin (this occurred with hardly any advertising and without a proper brochure).",
     Foddee ve dy lhisagh Mannin jannoo arrish er y Chorn as dy lhisagh ee shirrey y shiaghtoo cohionnal y ve cummit ayns Mannin ayns 1983.,     It could be that the Isle of Man should repeat Cornwall and it should ask for the sixth conference to be held in the Isle of Man in 1983.,
Ta Mannin ayns feme jeh red ennagh goll rish yn Undinaght jeh Studeyrys Cornagh., The Isle of Man needs something like the Foundation for Cornish Studies.,
Ta’n Undinaght shoh geddyn barrantys as argid voish Ollooscoill Exeter as Coonseil Chondae y Chorn ry cheilley.,This Foundation receives commission and finance from the University of Exeter and the County Council of Cornwall together.,
Ta’n oollooscoill as y choonseil co-stiurey yn Undinaght.,The university and the council co-direct the Foundation.,
"She kiarail ny h-Undinaght “dy chur er y hoshiaght, dy cho-oardaghey, as dy chooney lesh dy chooilley horch sy studeyrys Cornagh —","It is the intention of the Foundation “to establish, to co-arrange and to assist with every sort of Cornish study —",
"ta shen dy ghra, y studeyrys jeh sheelnaue sy cheer ynnydagh (y Corn as Ellanyn Scilly) sy traa hie shaghey, ec y traa t’ayn nish, as sy traa ry heet.”","that is to say, the study of humanity in the local country (Cornwall and thr Scilly Isles) the time gone by, at the current time and in the future.”",
"     Fo kiannoortys e stiureyder vreeoil, yn Olloo Charles Thomas, fer Curnagh, ta reddyn er jeet lesh yn Undinaght.","     Under the governance of its energetic director, Professor Charles Thomas, a Cornish fellow, the foundation has been successful.",
"Ta e sleih-obbree goaill stiagh yn Olloo Thomas, un Ard-er Aa-hirrey, kiare Fir Aa-hirrey lane-emshyragh, un ’er Aa-hirrey Onnoragh as daa chleragh.","His workforce includes Professor Thomas, the Head researcher, four part time researchers, one honorary professor and two clerks.",

Ayns yn earishlioar shoh, ta pabyryn bentyn rish ny sheeanyn dooghyssagh, glare as fo-ghlare, as shennaghys sheshoil as shennaghys caggee.","The breadth of studies of the foundation is visible from their own journal. In this journal there are papers concerning the native sounds (sciences?), language and dialect, and social history and military history.",
Sheeu toiggal nagh vel ollooscoill erbee sy Chorn hene she stashoon cheu-mooie jeh Ollooscoill Exeter yn Undinaght.,"It’s worth realising that there isn’t any university at all in Cornwall itself, the Foundation is a station outside of Exeter University.",

"Ec y traa t’ayn, veagh eh keeallagh dy chiangley lheid y scoillarys lesh Thie Tashtee Vannin.","At the current time, it would be sensible to tie such scholarship in with the Manx Museum.",
" Agh y red smoo scanshoil, shen dy chur er bun Undinaght jeh Studeyrys Manninagh."," But the most important thing, that is to establish a Foundation of Manx Studies. ",
