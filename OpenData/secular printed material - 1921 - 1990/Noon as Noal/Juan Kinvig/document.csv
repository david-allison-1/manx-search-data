Car ny bleeantyn caggee va mee cheet noal gys yn Ellan mysh queig keayrt ’sy vlein ceau laghyn-seyr veih ny schoillyn ayns Sostyn.,"During the war years, I was coming over to the Island about five times a year, spending holidays from the schools in England.",

"Va mee bunnys er roshtyn y thie tra haink Juan hene ass y thie-ollee, v’eh ny ghooinney coar, lhean as lajer ayns callin, as neeal oor as faasaag dhoo echey, ga dy row eh erskyn kiare feed vlein dy eash ec y traa shen.","I had almost reached the house when John himself came out of the cattle-shed, he was a pleasant man, broad and strong in body, with a fresh complexion and a black beard, although he was above eighty years of age at that time.",
"Nish, va mee my yoarree da as gyn-dooyrt v’eh smooinaghtyn dy re Sostnagh mish rouail er bayryn ny cheerey, agh tra dooyrt mee ’sy Ghailck, “Cren aght ta shiu, Vainster Kinvig?” haink gearey harrish e eddin as dreggyr eh,","Now, I was a stranger to him and no doubt he was thinking that I was an Englishman wandering on country roads, but when I said in Manx “How are you Mr. Kinvig?” a smile came over his face and he answered,",
" “Ta mee ayns slaynt vie, booise da Jee, as ta mee geddyn bit dy bee voish laa gys laa, as choud as ta mee geddyn shen cha bee aggle dou, yiowym trooid anshaght” (‘some way’). "," “I’m in good health, thank God, and I’m getting a bit of food from day to day, and whilst I’m getting that I won’t be afraid, I’ll get through some way”. ",

T’ad jeeaghyn dooin cren sorch dy ghooinney va Mnr. Kinvig.,They show me what sort of man Mr. Kinvig was.,

",
"     Ny sanmee, tra va enney ny share aym er, hug mee arrym as keainid da, v’eh dooinney lurg my chree-hene, ynrick, sheelt, kenjal as feoiltagh, as ny smoo na shen v’eh fer-keirdey gollrhym-pene, as laueyn mie echey.","     Later, when I knew him better, I respected and was fond of him, he was a man after my own heart, honest, sober, kind and generous, and more than that, he was a tradesman like myself, and had good hands.",
"Eer ayns e henn eash, hrog eh thie-ollee ass[2] claghyn cruinn ec y voayl-hene, obbyr feer ghoillee as doccaragh.","Even in his old age, he built a cattle-shed from round stones at his own place, a very difficult and hard job.","[2] ass] ‘out of’, ‘from’. The expected word here would be [jeh] ‘of’, ‘from’."
Ren eh myrgeddin creelyn-suggane as reddyn elley da’n Thie Tashtee Manninagh ayns Doolish.,He also made straw-rope creels and other things for the Manx Museum in Douglas.,

"
"     Va cloan mooar oc,[4] daa ghuilley as hoght ’neenyn, as ta mee credjal dy vel hoght jeu bio foast.","     They had a large number of children, two boys and eight girls, and I believe that eight of them are still alive.",[4] Va cloan mooar oc] ‘They had a large amount of children’ — evidently this is the intended meaning. [Va cooid vooar dy chloan oc] or [Va ymmodee cloan oc] would be expected here.
"     Choud’s v’eh foast ny ghooinney aeg, ghow eh toshiaght dy obbragh er e choontey hene, as ta mee sheiltyn dy re shen yn oyr va’n ennym y “Contractor” currit er.","     Whilst he was still a young man, he started to work on his own account, and I imagine that that is the reason the name the “Contractor” was given to him.",
Hrog eh Halley MacLaig ayns Ballabeg.,He built Halley MacLaig (Clague Hall) in Ballabeg.,
"V’eh currit gys ny cummaltee aegey jeh’n naboonys myr thie-haglee as fastee 'sy gheurey, ayns cooinaghtyn jeh y fer-lhee Juan MacLaig.[5]","It was given to the young residents of the neighbourhood as a meeting-house and shelter in the winter, in memory of Doctor John Clague.","[5] MacLaig] ‘Clague’ — The use of the Irish or Scottish Gaelic equivalent spellings of names, particularly surnames, was in vogue throught the 20thC.

"Fy-yerrey hooar Juan obbyr da Boayrd ny Keylljyn, karraghey ny boallaghyn as cleighyn er ny sleityn, as goaill arrey er ny biljyn ayns ny garaghyn-billagh.","Finally, John got a job for the Forestry Voard, mending the walls and hedges over the mountains, and watching the trees in the plantations.",

     Va lheid y chree ghooie echey nagh jinnagh eh rieau bwoailley cretoor balloo erbee.,     He had such a kind heart that he wouldn’t ever strike any dumb creature.,
"Ta mee er chlashtyn dy beagh cabbyl “tram” veih Doolish ec “Gehelen” dagh geurey as tra haink y laa dy paartail rish y cabbyl, ec toshiaght y touree, v’eh gollrish coayl shenn charrey!","I have heard that there would be a tram horse from Douglas at “Gehelen” every winter and when the day came to part with the horse, at the start of the summer, it was like losing an old friend!",
"     Laa souree dy row, va “Juan Dan” ayns Doolish er y chooylaghan as honnick cabbyl-‘tram’ eh.","     One Summer day, ‘Juan Dan’ was in Douglas, on the promenade, and he saw a tram horse.",

","     I am proud that I can count John Kinvig and his wife Sage amongst my true friends, they were indeed a wonderful couple, and I was thinking about Juan Dan in particular when I wrote the Dedication in my booklet “Conversational Manx’ in the year 1953.
