Cre ta shiuish coontey jeh’n eie shen? ,What do you you think of that idea?,

Cha n’yrrys dy vel graih ec Jamys er y Ghaelg as lheid y shennayr echeysyn.,No wonder James loves Manx having such an ancestor. ,
"Nagh screeu Cregeen, “My ta keim ’sy laair bee keim ’sy lhiy?”","Didn’t Cregeen write, “If there’s an amble in the mare there’ll be an amble in the foal”?",

     Dy hyndaa yn fockle “For” ayns Gaelg — she obbyr ghoillee ee! ,     To translate the word “For” into Manx — it is a difficult job! ,
