Gyn dooyrt ta ymmodee studeyryn ny Gailck nish smooinaghtyn daue-hene “Quoi va’n dooinney shoh ayns Canada as Gailck echey?”,No doubt there are many stunts of Manx now who are thinking to themselves “Who was this man in Canada who knew Manx?”,
"     Ta mee sheiltyn nagh vel peiagh erbee bio ec y traa t’ayn nish agh mee hene t’er jeet ny whaiyl as er loayrt rish Juan ayns Gailck, as er n’ghoaill aaght marish as e ven ayns Kirkland Lake.","     I imagine there is no one alive at the present time but myself who has met and spoken to John in Manx, and has taken lodging (stayed) with him and his wife in Kirkland Lake.",
"Myr shoh, lhig dou ginsh diu red ennagh mychione y dooinney hene as kys haink shin dy ve nyn gaarjyn as cre’n traa taitnyssagh v’aym marish Juan ayns Canada.","So, let me tell you something about the man himself and how we came to be friends and what a wonderful time I had with John in Canada.",

"D’insh Juan dou dy row Gailck ec yn ayr echey as kuse dy shenn Vanninee ’sy valley, agh cha row ad coontey monney jeh’n Ghailck ec y traa shen, as b’egin da Juan tayrn dy chooilley ’ockle assdoo, briaght feyshtyn gollrish,","John told me that his father and some of the old Manx in the town knew Manx, but that they didn’t think much of Manx at that time, and John had to draw every word out of them, asking questions like, ",
“Cre ta shoh ayns Gailck? Cre’n aght t’ou gra shoh? Cre’n aght t’ou genmys shoh?”,“What is this in Manx? How do you say this? What do you call this?”,
derrey veagh ny shenn gheiney skee jeh as gra “Immee royd” as “ersooyl lhiat”. ,until the old men would be fed up with him and say “Go on your way” and “away with you”. ,
"Ny keayrtyn yiarragh ad “Bare dhyt jarrood y Ghailck, cha jean ee dy bragh cosney ping er dy (dty) hon ansherbee.”","Sometimes they would say “It would be better for you to forget Manx, it will never earn a penny for you anyway.”",

"     Dy jarroo, tra daase eh ny shinney as nagh vod[1] eh screeu lesh e laueyn kyndagh rish martarys, chionnee eh jeshaght-screeuee!","     Indeed, when he grew older and he can’t (couldn’t) write with his hands due to disability, he bough a writing-machine (typewriter)!",[1] dod] text gives [vod]
"     Lurg baase e ayr ayns 1912, hie e voir as cagh elley ny clienney dys Lherpuyl, as dy gerrid lurg shen va Juan poost, ","     After the death of his father in 1912, his mother and all the rest of the children went to Liverpool, and shortly after that John was married, ",
"agh va Juan shiaulley car bleeantyn yn chied Caggey Mooar, as tra va’n caggey ec jerrey hie Juan as e ven as cloan gys Canada.","but John was sailing during the years of the First Great War (First World War), and when the war ended John and his wife and children went to Canada.",

"     Eisht hie mee dy lhie as chaddil mee dy mie ayns shee, fea, as chiass, son t’eh gaase feayr ’syn oie ayns Ontario Twoaie eer ayns y tourey.","     Then I went to bed and I slept well, in peace, calm and heat, because it was getting cold at night in North Ontario, even in the Summer.",
"’Sy voghrey dee mee brishey-hroshtey mie, foddey ny share na red erbee ry gheddyn er “B.R.”","In the morning I ate a good breakfast, far better than anything available on “B.R.” (British Rail).",
"Va shin troailt rish ooryn gyn veg ry akin agh loghyn as keylljyn mooarey, agh fy yerrey hoal rosh shin gys Swastika.","We were travelling for hours with nothing to see by lakes and great forests, but at long last we arrived at Swastika.",
