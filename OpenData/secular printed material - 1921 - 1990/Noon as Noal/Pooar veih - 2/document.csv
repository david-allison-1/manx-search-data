Manx,English,Notes
LHAIH mee er y chiaghtin lioar enmyssit “The Languages of the British Isles Past and Present” liorish W. B. Lockwood. ,I read in the week a book called “The Languages of the British Isles Past and Present” by W. B. Lockwood. ,
"Lioar suimoil t’ee agh, atreih! Aynjee, ’sy rheynn bentyn rish Gaelg Vanninagh ta ny focklyn shoh goll er screeu[1] —","It’s an interesting book but, oh no! In it, in the section concerning Manx Gaelic, these words are written — ","[1] goll er screeu] ‘being written’, but here evidently intended to mean ‘are written’ for which we would expect [er ny screeu]. "
"“A careful enquiry just after the Second World War showed that only a score of native speakers were then left, all aged persons who had used Manx in their childhood ... ten years later these last guardian of the native tongue of Ellan Vannin were no more. Though Manx is extinct a number of Gaelic expression have passed into the English used locally.”",,
Myr yiarragh ny Yernee “Ta’n chooish caillt reesht!”,As the Irish would say “The thing is lost again!”,
     Cre woish ta ny ollooyn shoh geddyn yn ‘fys’ oc?,     Where are these professors getting their ‘knowledge’ from?,
Nagh vel ad rieau cheet lesh shilley er Mannin?,Don’t they ever come to visit the Isle of Man?,
T’ad lhaih lioaryn scruit ec Jackson as y lheid as t’ad credjal dy vel Gaelg marroo ’syn Ellan.,They read books written by Jackson and so on and they believe that Manx is dead in the Island.,
"Foddee dy jinnagh Audery screeu rish Professor W. B. Lockwood, f/c Deutch Ltd., 105 Great Russell Street, London, W.C.1, ginsh da dy vel marranys mooar echey as cur dasyn yn soilsheen ta mee aa-chlou ’sy cholloo shoh as goit aym ass yn earishlioar “Manxman” ta kiart er jeet magh.","Maybe Audery would write to Professor W. B. Lockwood, f/c Deutch Ltd., 105 Great Russell Street, London, W.C.1, telling him that he has a big error and give him the advert I am reprinting in this column and taken by me out of the “Manxman” magazine that has just come out.",
     Ta’n soilsheen shoh cur aggle orrym!,     This advertisement frightens me!,
T’eh dy my ghreinnaghey dy chooilleeney yn obbyr er yn ’ocklioar dy tappee.,It is urging me to complete the work on the dictionary quickly.,
"Bee eh cheet magh mysh Laa Tinvaal shoh cheet, son mie ny sie.","It will be coming out around next Tynwald Day, for good or bad (come what may).",
Cha noddym jannoo veg mychione echey nish.,I can’t do anything about it now.,
Bee marrannys ayn gyn ouyrys agh ’sy lhing ayms cha ren peiagh erbee elley cur laue da lheid yn obbyr as v’eh orrym dy yannoo eh my lomarcan agh son cooney mooar voish Brian Mac Stoyll as my chaarjyn aegey ren cur ny kaartyn ayns oardagh er my hon.,"There will be errors in it no doubt but in my era no one else put a hand to such a job and I had to do it alone, except for great help from Brian Stowell and my young friends who put the cards in order for me.",
Mannagh beagh y fockleyr jeant aym pene cha beagh eh er ve scruit er chor erbee as veagh y Ghaelg goll naardey beggan er veggan gyn focklyn noa cheet stiagh aynjee derrey veagh ee slane dyn-ymmyd da ny Gaelgeyryn aegey.,"Were it not that the dictionary was done by myself, it wouldn’t have been written at all and Manx would be decaying little by little without new words coming in to it until it would be completely useless for the young Manx speakers.",
Professor Lockwood apparently doesn’t know that it is my generation which rescued Manx from the last guardians of the native tongue of Ellan Vannin.,,
BREAGAGH.,BREAGAGH.,
POOAR VEIH CHESH-VEAN Y VRENEEN: CRE CHO GAUEAGH?,POWER FROM THE NUCLEUS OF THE ATOM: HOW DANGEROUS?,
"Myr screeu mee ayns Ayrn I jeh ny artyn shoh, ta ymmodee sleih treishteil dy jean pooar veih’n vreneen shin y livrey veih gyere-ghaue ny bree (the energy crisis).","As I wrote in Part I of these articles, many people hope that power from the atom will deliver (release) us from the energy crisis.",
"Dy hoiggal yn chooish shoh ny share, lhig dooin jeeaghyn er shennaghys as fishig chesh-veanagh.","To understand this subject better, let’s look at history and nuclear physics.",
     Va kuse dy henn Ghreagee credjal dy row dy chooilley nhee jeant ass floagyn ny breneenyn.,     There were ancient Greeks who believed that everything is made from specks (particles) or atoms.,

"Roish feer foodey, hooar skeeandee magh dy vel daa horch jeig as kiare feed dy vun-stoo ayn er y teihll.","Before very long, scientists discovered that there are ninety-two sorts of element on earth.",
"Ta shen dy ghra, dy dooghyssagh, ta daa horch jeig as kiare feed dy vreneen ayn.","That is to say, naturally, there are ninety-two types of atoms.",
Ta gagh bun-stoo jeant ass breneen er-lheh.,Each element is made out of a particular atom.,
She stoo-ushtey yn bun-stoo smoo neuchramp.,Hyrodgen is the most simple element.,
Shen dy ghra dy vel echey yn breneen smoo neuchramp.,"That is to say, that it has the simplest  atom.",
"Er y teihll shoh, she urraaniu yn bun-stoo smoo cramp.","In this world, uranian is the most complex element. ",
     Sy cheead shoh chaie (as roish shen) va fys ec sleih dy vel bun-stooghyn sniemmey ry cheilley as jannoo co-vroojidyn.,     In the past century (and before that) people knew that elements combine together and make compounds.,
"Myr sampleyr, my ta stoo-ushtey as ossagien cheet ry cheilley dy cooie, ta ushtey goll er croo.","For example, if hydrgen and oxygen come together suitably, water is created.",
"She co-vroojid yn ushtey, jeant ass daa vun-stoo (stoo-ushtey as ossagien).","The water is a compound, made from two elements (hydrogen and oxygen).",
"Tra ta ushtey goll er croo ass stoo-ushtey as ossagien, ta breneenyn jeh stoo-ushtey as ossagien sniemmey ry cheilley as jannoo co-vreneenyn jeh ushtey.","When water is being created from from oxygen and hydrogen, atoms of hydrogen and oxygen combine together and make molecules of water.",
"Dy firrinagh, bare dooin gra dy vel dy chooilley red jeant ass co-vreneenyn as cha nee breneeyn.","Actually, we’d be better saying that everything is made from molecules and not atoms.",
Ta’n co-vreneenyn jeh ushtey (daa vreneen jeh stoo-ushtey as breneen jeh ossagien sniemmit dy cheilley liorish ‘geuley’ lectragh) neuchramp dy liooar.,The molecule of water (two atoms of hydrogen and an atom of oxygen joined to each other by an electric chain) is simple enough.,
"     Feer vie, shione dooin nish dy vel gagh nhee jeant ass co-vreneenyn as dy vel co-vreneenyn jeant ass breneenyn.","     Very well, we know now that everything is made from molecules and that molecules anre made out of atoms.",
Agh vel ny breneenyn jeant ass corpeenyn elley?,But are the molecules made from other bodies?,
Dy jarroo ta.,"Actually, yes.",
Yeeagh Rutherford as fir elley da’n teihll dy vel gagh breneen goll rish lught-greiney.,Rutherford and others showed the world that every atom is like a constellation.,
Ta chesh-vean trome ec gagh breneen as ta lectraneyn goll mygeayrt y chesh-vean.,Every atom has a heavy (dense) nucleus and there are electrons going around the nucleus.,
"Ta chesh-vean gagh breneen goll rish y ghrian, beggan, as ta ny lectraneyn goll rish ny mec-greiney ta goll mygeayrt y ghrian.","The nucleus of every atom is like the sun, a little, and the electrons are like the planets that go around the sun.",
Va ooilley yn fys shoh ec ny skeeandee roish as dy jeeragh lurg y Chied Chaggey Mooar.,The scientists had this knowledge before and right after the First World War. ,
     Sy vlein 1896 va’n fishigagh Frangagh Becquerel er ngeddyn magh dy vel lheid y red as scell-vreeoilys ayn.,In 1896 the French phyisicist Becquerel had discovered that there was such a thing as radioactivity.,
Hooar eh magh dy vel urraaniu cur magh scellyn neuakinagh ta cur er plaityn-fotot dy ve doo (ta sleih foast jannoo ymmyd jeh’n saase shoh ry hoi feddyn magh vel scell vreeoilyn ayn).,He found out that uranian sends out invisible rays that make photographic plates black (people are still using this method for detecting radioactivity).,
"Roish foddey, va ny fishigee er ngeddyn magh dy vel tree sorchyn dy scell cheet dy dooghyssagh veih urraaniu as veih bun-stooghyn elley goll rish raadiu.","Before long the physicists had discovered that there are three types of ray coming naturally from uranian and from other elements, such as radium.",
"Ta shin gra scellyn-alpha, beta as gamma rish ny tree sorchyn shoh.","We call these three types alpha, beta and gamma rays.",
"     Hoshiaght, ny scellyn-alpha, er nonney ny sorpeeyn-alpha.","     First, the alpha rays, otherwise (termed) the ??? (alpha-particles???).",
She ny chesh-veanyn jeh breneenyn heeliu ad shoh.,These are the nuclui of helium atoms.,
Cha nel scellyn-alpha goll trooid stoo dy haashagh mannagh vel bree vooar oc.,Alpha-rays do not go through material easily unless they have great energy.,
"Ny scellyn-alpha ta cheet veih farraneyn dooghyssagh jeh scell-vreeoilys, cha nel bree vooar oc as er y hon shen cha nel ad feer ghaueagh, agh my ta shin gee stoo ta spreih magh scellyn-alpha as ta shin freayll y stoo shen festit sy chorp, ta shen gaueagh dy liooar. ","The alpha-rays that come from natural sources of radiation, they don’t have great energy and because of that they aren’t very dangerous, but if we eat stuff that sprays out alpha-rays and we keep that stuff stuck in the body, that is pretty dangerous. ",
Cre’n fa gaueagh?,Why dangerous?,
Er y fa dy vod dy chooilley horch dy scell-vreeoilys kahngyr y chroo ayns kirp jeh reddyn bio.,Because every type of radiation can create cancer in bodies of living things.,
     Ta scell-vreeoilys jannoo reddyn rish killagyn bio nagh vel shin toiggal ro vie. Shione dooin dy vel scell-vreeoilys bwoalley magh lectraneyn ass co-vreneeynyn t’ayn y raad.,     Radiation does things to living cells that we don’t understand too well. We know that radiation knocks electons out of molecules that are in the way.,
"My ta ny co-vreneenyn shoh nyn aryrn jeh killad vio, ta’n chillag er ny caghlaa.","If these molecules are part of a living cell, the cell is changed.",
"Ny keayrtyn, ta kahngyr goaill toshiagh myr shen.","Sometimes, cancer begins like that.",
Red quaagh t’ayn; foddee scell-vreeoilys kahngyr y chur fo raad ny eh y lheihys.,Here’s a strange thing; radiation can get cancer started or heal it. ,
"     Goll er ash dys fishig, she lectraneyn scellyn beta, as she scellyn lectramagnadagh scellyn-gamma.","Going back to physics, beta-rays are electrons, and gamma-rays are electromagnetis rays.",
Ta scellyn-gamma cliaghtey foddey ny smoo gaueagh na ny scellyn elley.,Gamma rays are usually far more dangerous than other rays.,
Foddee ny scellyn-gamma goll trooid plaityn chiu dy leoaie.,Gamma rays can pass through thick plates of lead.,
"Ta fys ain ooilley dy vel scellyn-X, alpha, beta as gamma croo kahngyr.","We all know that X, alpha, beta and gamma rays cause (create) cancer.",
Agh vel cagliagh-sauchys ayn?,But is there a safe limit?,
