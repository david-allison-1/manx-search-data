Manx,English,Notes
Noon as Noal'To and Fro',,
DOONAGHT FLIUGH,A WET SUNDAY,
"Va ram sleih ’sy cheeill Jedoonee chaie ec y chirveish Ghaelgagh ayns Skylley Maayl. Laa rastagh, fliaghagh, groamey v’ayn dy jarroo agh haink ny manninee dooie gys y chirveish as v’ee feer speeidelagh.","There were a lot of people in the church last Sunday at the Manx service in Kirk Michael. It was a gusty, rainy, miserable day indeed, but the true Manx came to the service and it was very successful.",
By ghoogh lhieen[1] clashtyn dy daink teaym ennagh er Royston Curleod ayns gleashtan Audrey Ainsworth as dy row Audrey eignit dy chur lesh nyn garrey gys Thie Lheihys ayns Doolish.,"We were sorry to hear that Royston Corlett had a fit (or perhaps ‘heart attack’, or ‘stroke’?) in Audrey Ainsworth’s car and that Audery had to take our friend to a Hospital in Douglas.","[1] By ghoogh lhieen] unattested elsewhere, but evidently intended to mean ‘We were sorry’."
Ta treisht orrin ooilley dy jig reddyn lesh Royston dy tappee as dy jean eh couyral dy gerrid.,We all hope that Royston will manage things quickly and that he will recover shortly.,
"Va cooish feer vie as cappan dy hey erreish da’n chirveish ayns halley ny skeerey as ghow dagh ooilley pheiagh soylley mooar jeh’n ’astyr, gyn y wooise da’n sterrym as fliaghey.","There was a very good ‘cooish’ (social chat) and a cup of tea after the service in the parish hall and everyone greatly enjoyed the afternoon, no thanks to the storm and rain.",
THE THREE FASTEST THINGS IN THE SEA,,
"     Cheayll mee keayrt dy row voish Manninagh dooie y raa beg shoh, mychione ny tree reddyn s’bieauee t’ayn y cheayn. “Gimmagh, Breck as Raun, ny tree reddyn s’bieauee t’ayn.”","I once heard this little saying from a native Manxman, about the three fastest things in the sea. “a Lobster, a Mackerel and a Seal, the three fastest things there are.”",
"Tra, t’ou smooinaghtyn mychione y chooish ta shiu fakin dy row yn shenn sleih slane kiart tra dooyrt ad y lhied.",When you think about the matter you see that the old people were entirely right when they said such a thing.,
"Ta raa elley ayn nagh jeanym dy bragh jarrood. Ny tree reddyn s’feayrey t’ayn, “Ingan gaauin, stroin coiyn as thoyn woirrinagh.” Nod shiu cur Baarle er shen?","There’s another saying I won’t ever forget. The three coldest things there are, “A smith’s anvil, a hound’s nose and a female’s bottom.” Can you give the English for that?",
"Ny tree geayghyn s’feayrey t’ayn, “Geay hennui, geay fo’n shiaull as geay trooid towl.” Va ram raghyn myr shen ec yn chenn sleih as by vie lhiam clashtyn tooilley veuesyn my vees yn lheid eu.","The three coldest winds, “a thawing wind, wind under a sail and wind through a hole.” The old people had a lot of sayings like that and I would like to hear more of them if you have such things.",
CARRICK NY KYLLIU,The Calf Fishing Rock,
     Ta’n caslys ain yn shiaghtin shoh ny henn chaslys jeh’n thie soilshey goll y troggal[2] er yn “Chiggin Wooar” myr yiarragh Ned Maddrell.,Our picture this week is an old picture of the lighthouse being built on the “Big ‘Chiggin’” as Ned Maddrell would say.,[2] goll y troggal] goll er troggal
"Va ny blick ooilley er nyn yiarrey, as er nyn goyrt cooidjagh hoshiaght er y Cheiy ayns Purt Le Moirrey, eisht currit veih my cheilley as currit lesh gys y chreg ayns baatyn raad v’ad goll y troggal[3] reesht!","The blocks were all cut, and put together first on the Quay in Port St Mary, then taken apart and brought to the rock in boats where they were being built again!",[3] goll y troggal] goll er troggal
S’croutagh va ny shenn seyir-chlagh.,How cunning the old masons were.,
Ayns ny skeeallyn scruit liorish Ned Beg Hom Ruy t’eh genmys y creg “Yn Chiggin”.,In the stories written by Ned Beg Hom Ruy (Edward Faragher) he calls the rock “The ‘Chiggin’”.,
"Va Ned genmys eh “Creg ny h-Ein”, agh ta’n ennym kiart er “Carrick Ny Kylliu.”","Ned called it “The Rock of the Chicks”, but the correct name of it is “The Sea Rock of the Calf of Man”.",
"Hee shiu y fockle “Kylliu” ayns fockleyr Archie Cregeen, yn gennidagh jeh “Colloo”.","You will see the word “Kylliu” in Archie Cregeen’s dictionary, the genitive of “Colloo”.",
"Myr ta fys eu ooilley, hie yn thie soilshey shoh er aile kuse dy vleeantyn er dy henney as cha nel freilleyderyn erbee ayn nish.","As you all know, this lighthouse caught fire a few years ago and there are no keepers in it now.",
"S’quaagh eh ny laghyn t’ayn jiu dy ’akin, cha nee daa hie soilshey ’syn un voayl, tree er y Cholloo hene as nane er y chreg!",How strange it is these days to see not two lighthouses in the same place — three on the Calf itself and one on the rock!,
"Foastagh, ta baatyn goll shaghey “Yn Chiggin Wooar”, gyn, myr dooyrt Neddy Beg “Sthroogey yn creg”!","Still, there are boats going past “The Big ‘Chiggin’”, without, as Ned Beg said “Stroking the rock”!",
“ARABAGH VECCA”,The Arab of Mecca,
Skeeal elley voish nyn garrey Juan y Comish.,Another story from our friend John Comish.,
"AYNS yn Imbagh Troailtee Crauee ’sy vlein 1909, hie shin dys Ellan Lambok ta ny lhie mysh keead meeilley voish traie Yava, dy ghoaill er y lhong kiare feed as tree deiney jeig[4] va jannoo yn marrinys dys Jeddah, as veih shen dys Mecca as Medina.","In the Pilgimage Season (‘Season of the Pilgrims) in the year 1909, we went to Lambok Island that lies about a hundred miles from the shore of Java, to take on the ship ninety-three men who were making the voyage to Jeddah, and from there to Mecca and Medina.","[4] kiare feed as tree deiney jeig] ‘ninety three men’, in Classical Manx; [kiare feed dooinney as tree-jeig]."
"Cha row purt ayns yn ellan as begin dooin lhie ec aker ayns “Apenan Landing”, as cha row eh feer foddey derrey haink ny baatyn beggey magh ass yn ellan hooin, dagh ooilley nane lane jeh ny h-ellanee va son cheet marin, as mysh thousane elley dy gheiney as dy vraane v’er jeet dy ghra, “Shooill marish y Chiarn Allah” roosyn.","The island had no harbour and we had to lie at anchor in “Apenan Landing” (Ampenan Landing, Lombok, Indonesia), and it wasn’t very long until the little boats came out to us from the island, every one of them full of the islanders who were for coming with us, and about another thousand men and women who had come to say “Walk with the Lord Allah” to them.",
"Cha daink ben erbee dy ghoaill lhuingys, she ooilley deiney v’ayn.","No woman at all came to embark, they were all men.",
"Va’n chooid smoo jeu nyn gheiney aegey, glen as rooisht gys y vouin, fuilt liauyrey orroo, as adsyn feer vioyr er nyn gassyn, anchasley rish ny Javanee. V’adsyn slack er dagh ooilley chor.","The majority of them were young men, clean and naked to the waist, with long hair, and they were very lively on their feet, unlike the Javanese. They were slack in every way.",
"     Va mee jeeaghyn harrish cheu ny lhuingey er ny baatyn dooie va nyn lhie ry lhiattee ain tra cheayll mee coraa ard troggit dy jeean, loayrt rish troor dy vraane va nyn shassoo ayns toshiaght y vaatey veg va ny lhie faggys dooin, as honnick mee dy daink y coraa voish arabagh ooasle, coamrit dy mie, ny ghelleyder foddee, as eshyn loayrt rish ny tree mraane echey, mraane mooar roauyr stoamey ’syn aght shinney lesh ny h-Arabee ny mraane oc!","     I was looking over the side of the ship at the native boats that were lying aside us when I heard a loud voice raised suddenly, talking to a trio of women who were stood in the bow (prow) of the little boat that was lying near to us, and I saw that the voice came from an Arab of status, well dressed, a dealer maybe, and he was talking to his three wives, big, fat, grand women in the style the Arabs love their women!",
"Er lhiam dy row yn ard-choraa echey dy yeeaghyn da ny deiney elley dy row eh ny ghooinney berchagh as argid dy liooar echey dy chur palchey bee da ny mraane echey, as nagh row eh femoil dauesyn dy yannoo obbyr erbee.","I think his loud voice was to show to the other men that he was a wealthy man and that he had enough money to give plenty of food to his women, and that he didn’t need them to do any work at all.",
Cha row monney keayn roie ayns shen raad v’ad agh va toshiaght y vaatey veg girree as tuittym mysh trie dy lieh.,"There was much sea running there where they were, but the bow (prow) of the little boat was rising and falling about a foot and half (46cm).",
"Fy yerrey, dy daaney heeyn magh nane jeh ny mraane e laue as ghow ee greim er laue yn dooinney tra va toshiaght y vaatey tuittym sheese, as huitt adsyn ooilley, y kaire jeu, ’sy cheayn, as by vooar yn obbyr ain dy hayrn adsyn magh ass y cheayn reesht, as adsyn fliugh nyn drooid gollrish roddanyn baiht!","Finally, one of the women boldly reached out her hand and she took hold of the man’s hand when the prow (bow) of the boat was falling down, and they all fell, the four of them, into the sea, and what a great job we had to pull them out of the sea again, with them being wet through like drowned rats!",
"     Va’n seyr as y guilley baatey nyn hassoo[5] er y lout eaghtyragh marym moghrey er giyn as va shin loayrt rish Bill as fer elley jeh’n skimmee, tra honnick shin yn Arabagh Mooar hene cheet nyn aare er y chassan, shooyl dy moal marish ardcheim vooar.","     The carpenter (chippy) and the bosun were standing on the top deck with us a subsequent morning and we were talking to Bill and another of the crew, when we saw the Great Arab himself approaching us on the walkway (or, ‘promenade deck’), walking slowly with a great dignity.",[5] nyn hassoo] [nyn shassoo}
"Tra rosh eh orrin, chroym eh e chione, as dooyrt eh ayns Baarle “Goodmorning sirs.” Hug shin dasyn “Moghrey Mie Jack”, ny “Moghrey Mie Johnny” ayns aght jesh dy liooar and tra v’eh er n’gholl shagh’ ain, loayr eh reesht as dooyrt eh “God damn bloody Liverpool!” (Mollaght Yee er Lerphul fuiltagh).","When he reached us, he bent his head and he said in English “Good morning sirs.” We gave him “Good Morning Jack”, or “Good Morning Johnny” in a nice enough way and when he had gone past us, he spoke again and he said ““God damn bloody Liverpool!”",
     Yeeagh yn kiare j’in er y cheilley goaill yindys cre ’sy theihll va shin er chlashtyn!,"     The four of us looked at eachother, wondering what in the world we had heard!",
"Ghow shin yindys cre va bun ny goan thanvaanagh shoh! agh hie eshyn roish, gyn fockle elley.","We were wondering what was the meaning of these astonishing words! but he went on, without another word.",
"     Honnick shin dy row tree kerroo-chiarkil er gagh lieckan echey as dinsh Bill dooin dy row adsyn cowraghyn dy row eshyn er ve ruggit ayns Mecca hene, yn ard valley casherick, as kyndagh rish shen, v’eh shickyr jeh Pargys tra yoghe eh baase!","     We saw that there were three quarter circles on each of his cheeks and Bill told us that they were signs that he had been born in Mecca itself, the holy city, and because of that, he was sure of Paradise when he would die!",
"     Fy yerrey, lurg mooarane coloayrtys eddyr ain, dooyrt Ted Graham, yn guilley baatey, ny ghooinney Yernagh-Lerphullagh eh hene, “Myr ta mish fakin eh, daag Johnny shid e heer hene ayns lhong ennagh as deiney-aile Lerphullagh urree, as dynsee adsyn eshyn dy beagh eh sorch dy vannaghey! Myr dy beagh sorch dy “Ta laa braew ayn jiu!”","     Finally, after a lot of conversation between us, Ted Graham, the bosun himself, a Liverpool-Irish man, said “As I see it, that yonder Johnny left his own country in a ship with Liverpool firemen on it, and they taught him that that it would be a sort of greeting! As if it were a sort of “It’s a fine day today!”",
"Shen ta mee smooinaghtyn, Eoineen, as cha row fys ny share ec yn dooinney boght! Lhisagh fer ennagh ginsh dasyn bun ny focklyn!","That is what I think, Johnny, and the poor man didn’t know any better! Someone ought to tell him the meaning of the words!",

[gagh] does not generally cause lenition; [gagh moghrey], or [dagh moghrey] would be expected here."
BEFORE ECUMENISM,BEFORE ECUMENISM,
"S’yndyssagh eh dy akin yn aght ta ny Gaelgeyryn nish ooilley gooashley Jee ’syn un cheeill, gyn boirey erbee mychione yn rheynn-chredjue oc.","How wonderful it is to see the way the Manx speakers now all worship God in the same church, without any bother about their denomination.",
"Ta shin fakin Anglicaanee, Saasilee, Creestee Raueagh, An-chreesteeyn, Anhrinaidee as y lhied, ooilley nyn soie cooidjagh ayns caarjys as comeeys.","We see Anglicans, Methodists, Roman Catholics, ‘heathens’, Unitarians and such, all seated together in friendship and fellowship.",
"Cha row eh rieau myr shoh ayns ny shenn laghyn ayns Mannin, ayns laghyn yn Aachummey as ny yei, tra va noidys ommidagh eddyr dagh ooilley rheynn-chredjue as adsyn ooilley shickyr dy row yn “sect” ocsyn yn un raad firrinagh[7] dys Niau.","It was never like this in the old days in the Isle of Man, in the days of the reformation and after, when there was foolish hostility between every denomination with them all sure that their sect was the one true way to Heaven.",[7] yn un raad firrinagh] ‘the same true way’ evidently the intended meaning is ‘the one true way’ for which we might expect [yn ynrican raad firrinagh] ‘the only true way’. 
"Mysh y traa shen va drane veg goll mygeayrt cheer ny Gaeljee mychione yn agglish noa va currit er bun liorish Henry Hoght, Ree Hostyn, tra v’eh laccal dy phoosey foast ben elley!","About that time there was a little verse going around the land of the Gaels about the new church that was established by Henry VIII, King of England, when he was wanting to marry yet another woman!",
"Dy hoiggal eh, shegin fys ve eu dy vel y fockle “maggle” as “clagh “ yn un red ayns Gaelg chadjin!","To understand it, you must know that the word “testicle” and “stone” is the same thing in common Gaelic!",
