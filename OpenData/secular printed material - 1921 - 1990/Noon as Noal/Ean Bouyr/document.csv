SKEEAL VOISH ELLAN MUILE,A STORY FROM THE ISLE OF MULL,
"Recorded from Alec MacDougall, Haun, Isle of Mull, July 1967",,
Ren Ean Bouyr cummal ayns Chibbyr Woirrey (Tobermory). Mackinnon v’eh as v’eh ny hiaulteyr mie.,Deaf Ian lived in Mary’s Well (Tobermorey). He was a Mackinnon and he was a good sailor.,
"Hie yn baatey echey stiagh ayns Purt Glasgoe yn oie shoh, as hooar yn skimmee er cheer son yn oie.","His boat went into Port Glasgow this night, and the crew got ashore for the night.",
Ren Ean as jees elley faagail y baatey cooidjagh as hie ad stiagh ayns thie oast as ghow ad toshiaght dy iu.,Ian and two others left the boat together and they went into the inn and they they started to drink.,
"Haink jeih er y chlag as hrog ad orroo, adsyn va marish, agh cha row eshyn son goll er chor erbee, derrey veagh eh ceaut magh ass y thie oast.","Ten o’clock came and they got up, those who were with him, but he couldn't go at all, until he’d be thrown out of the inn.",
"Cre haghyr, choud as v’eshyn ersooyl veih’n vaatey, haink baatey joarree stiagh as v’er y vaatey va Ean ayn dy scughey ass yn voayl v’eh ayn dy lhiggey ny joarreeyn stiagh, son va driss orroo dy gheddyn ersooyl, va’n oie feer sterrymagh.","What happened, whilst he was away from the boat, a foreign boat came in and the boat Ian was in had to shift from the place it was in to let the foreigners in, because they were in a rush to get away, the night was very stormy.",
"Ansherbee, raink eh fy-yerrey raad va’n baatey echey er ve, as foast smooinaghtyn dy row eh e vaatey hene v’ayn, hooyl[1] eh er boayrd. ","Anyway, he finally arrived where his boat had been, still thinking that it was his own boat there, he walked on board. ",[1] hooyl] [huill]
Heeyn eh magh eh hene er carnane dy headdyn as huitt eh ny cadley.,He stretched himself out (lay down) on a heap of clothes and he fell asleep.,
"     Agh cre ren y baatey agh dy gholl lesh y cheayn[2] er yn oie as tra v’eh shaghey Meayl Chione Cheerey (the Mull of Kintyre), va brishey’n laa as va’n skimmee er y vaatey goll mygeayrt as hooar ad yn dooinney shoh ny cadley mastey ny teaddyn.","     But what did the boat do but go to sea in the night and when it was past the Land’s End Headland (The Mull of Kintyre), there was daybreak and the team on the boat were going round and they found this man asleep amongst the ropes.",[2] dy gholl lesh y cheayn] ‘to go towards the sea’ but here the intended meaning is evidently ‘go to sea’.
As hie ad dy akin y captan as dinsh ad da dy row dooinney er boayrd nagh lhisagh ve er boayrd.,And they went to see the captain and they told him that there was a man aboard who shouldn't have been aboard.,
"     “Aw well,”  as y captan, “Cur eh ayns sack as ceau eh harrish boayrd.”","     “Oh, well,” says the captain, “Put him in a sack and throw him overboard.”",
     Hie ad er ash as ghooisht ad Ean Bouyr as dinsh ad da dy row oardaghyn oc veih’n chaptan dy chur eh ayns sack as dy cheau eh harrish boayrd.,     They went back and they woke Deaf Ian and they told him that they had orders from the captain to put him in a sack and to throw him overboard.,
"     “Oh dy jarroo,” dooyrt Ean Bouyr, “Veagh shiu cha kenjal as dy chur mee ayns mullag?”","      “Oh indeed,” said Deaf Ian, “Would you be so kind as to put me in a cask?”",
"     Hie ad er ash da’n chaptan reesht. Dooyrt ad rish, “Ta’n fer shen briaght son dy ve currit ayns mullag.”","     They went back to the captain again. They said to him, “That fellow is asking to be put in a cask.”",
"      “Oh jean shen, ta palchey dy vullagyn folmey er boayrd — cur eh ayns mullag son shickyrys, agh bee-jee shickyr dy cheau eh magh harrish boayrd.”","      “Oh do that, there’s plenty of empty casks onboard — put him in a cask for sure, but be sure to throw him our overboard.”",
"     Hie ad er ash, hug ad Ean Bouyr ’sy vullag, hrog ad seose ee, agh vrie eh jeu dy beagh ad cha kenjal as dy yannoo towl beg aynjee dy voddagh eh geddyn aer, as ren ad shen.","      They went back, they put Deaf Ian in the cask, they picked him it up, but he asked them if they would be so king as to make a little hole in it so that he could get air, and they did that.",
"As cheau ad magh y vullag ec Meayl Chione Cheerey, as va laa sterrymagh ayn.","And they threw the cask out at the Mull of Kintyre, and there was a stormy day.",
"     Well, laa ny vairagh[3] hie yn vullag er cheer ayns Eeley, as she traa yn vooir-hraie v’ayn tra hie ee er cheer, as va aggle er Ean dy jinnagh y gheay arraghey tra harragh yn roayrt, dy beagh eh goll magh reesht, as ghow eh toshiaght dy yannoo yn towl ny smoo, dy yannoo eh mooar lesh y skynn echey. ","     Well, the next day the cask came ashore in Islay, and it at the time of low-tide when he came ashore, and Ian was afraid that the wind would move (him?) when the incoming tide would come, (and) he would go out (to sea) again, and he started to make the hole bigger, to make it big with his knife. ",[3] laa ny vairagh] text gives [laa ny mairagh]
Ren eh lheanaghey yn towl wheesh shen dy row eh abyl dy chur y laue echey magh ass choud’s yn geaylin.,He widened the hole so much that he was able to put his hand (arm) out as far as his shoulder.,
     Cre v’ayns shen agh guilley beg bochillagh maase heose erskyn y voorey as va tarroo mastey’n ollagh.,      What (Who) was there but a little boy herding cattle up above the beach and there was a bull amongst the cows.,
"Cheayll yn tarroo y sheean heese ayns shen er y traie as haink eh neose, doolaney y vullag as goll mygeayrt eck.","The bull heard the sound down there on the shore and he came down, challenging the cask and going around it.",
"Un jeh ny keayrtyn v’eh goll mygeayrt, hug Ean Bouyr magh e roih as ghow eh greim er yn famman echey as ersooyl lesh y tarroo!","One of the the times he was going around, Ian put out his arm and he got a hold of the its tail and the bull was away!",
"As cha jinnagh Ean lhiggey yn raad da’n tarroo derrey v’eh shickyr dy row eh er mark y lane, eisht lhig eh yn raad da.","And Ian wouldn’t let the bull go until he was sure that he was on the highwater mark, then he let it go. ",
"     Hie yn guilley roish cha tappee as yinnagh ny boynyn echey cur lesh eh, geamagh as keayney.","     The boy went as fast as his heels would bring him, shouting and crying.",
Va thie yn Shirveishagh yn thie by niessey as ren eh lesh y thie shen as dinsh eh da’n Shirveishagh (The Minister) dy row cretoor agglagh cloh er y tarroo er y voorey as haink yn Shirveishagh magh ass y thie marish. ,The Minister’s house was the closest house and he made towards that house and he told the minister that there was an fearful creature chasing away the bull on the beach and the Minster came out of the house with him. ,
"Riank ad heese ayns shen, hrog ad y vullag er e kione, doshil ad ee, as quoi v’ayns shid agh Ean Bouyr.","They arrived down there, they picked up the cask on it’s end, they opened it, and who was in there but Deaf Ian.",

"Cha row rieau enney ayms er Harry agh s’cooin lhiam shiartanse dy Vanninee doaieagh gollrish Harry, eer mannagh row y Gailck oc.","I never knew Harry but I remember several native Manx people like Harry, even if they didn’t know Manx.",

","     I think that Mark Braide was my first friend when I started learning Manx, and we were corresponding through the war years, then after that, we were going to the countryside sometimes to visit the old Manx people to learn Manx.",

[hug mee lhiam ad] ‘I brought them’ would be expected here."
"Eisht hie mee ersooyl dys Kerrookeyl dy gheddyn Mnr.
