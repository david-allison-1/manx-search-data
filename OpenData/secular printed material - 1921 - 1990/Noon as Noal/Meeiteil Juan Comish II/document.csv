Meeiteil Juan y Comish.,Meeting John Comish.,
"     Yn nah laa, Jymayrt, haink carrey Yuan elley gys y thie gra, “Ta shin goll gys y cabbane rish y logh, jean shiu cheet marin?”","     The next day, Tuesday, another friend of Juan’s came to the house saying, “When we go to the cabin by the lake, will you come with us?”",
V’eh Bill Duke as va e ven as daa ’neen marish.,It was Bill Duke and with his wife and two daughters.,
"Heill Juan as mish dy row ad goll son turrys ’sy carr as cheet er-ash reesht ’syn astyr, agh cha nee, begin dooin geddyn kuse dy eaddagh dy ghoaill marin, er yn oyr v’ad kiarail ceau kuse dy laghyn ’sy cabbane.","Juan and I thought that they were going for an excursion in the car and coming back again in the afternoon, but no, we would have get a few clothes to take with us, because they were planning to spend a few days in the cabin.",
Eisht ersooyl lhien ayns y carr mooar.,Then off we went in the big car.,
"Hoshiaght va’n raad feer vie, agh myr hie shin ny sodjey as ny sodjey stiagh ayns y cheyll vooar, cha row yn raad agh bayr coon, as fy-yerrey cha row agh cassan ayn leeideil gys y cabbane bunnys ec oirr ny logh, as cre cho vooar as va’n logh!","At first the route was very good, but as we went further and further into the forest, the road was only a lane, and finally there was only a footpath to lead to the cabin almost at the edge of the lake, and how big the lake was!",
"As y cabbane! V’eh “bungaow” feer yesh, troggit jeh fuygh, agh ard erskyn y thalloo lesh rheamys dy liooar fo’n laare dy reayll daa 'inneig (canoes).","And the cabin! It was a very nice bungalow, built of wood, but high above the ground with enough room under the floor to keep two canoes.",
"Greieyn er-jerrey (outboard) as stoo elley, as va keiy beg fuygh sheeyney magh ayns y logh.","An outboard motor and other stuff, and there was a small wooden jetty stretching out in the lake.",
"Va emshir vraew ghrianagh ayn, agh ’syn oie v’eh feayr dy liooar dy chur brasnagyn as fuygh er y coirrey!","The weather was fine and sunny, but in the night it was cold enough to put sticks and wood on the furnace!",
"Cha row feme orrin er geayl erbee! Veagh Juan as mish goll magh ayns y cheyll, reih billey juys, giarrey sheese eh, as saue eh ayns peeshyn, eisht ymmyrk ad ayns arrey-queeyl gys y cabbane dy ve scoltit lesh teiy.","We didn’t need coal any coal! Juan and I would be going out in the woods, choosing a pine tree, cutting it down, and sawing it into pieces, then carrying them in a wheelbarrow to the cabin to be split with an axe.",
"Cheau shin ram traa er y logh, dy mennick lesh maidjey-spaag, agh ny cheayrtyn lesh yn “outboard”.","We spent a lot of time on the lake, often with a paddle, but sometimes with the outboard.",
Veagh shin goll foddey dy eeastagh brick-ghoan.,We would go far to fish brown trout.,
Un laa hie shin tessyn y logh gys y cheu hoal as lurg kiangley y finneig hie shin er-thalloo ayns y cheyll.,One day we went across the lake to the far side and after tying the canoe we went ashore in the woods.,
Va ny biljyn feer vooar as ny lossreeyn as thammagyn feer hiu; lurg tammylt hooar shin tholtan dy waane-fuygh as cheusthie va ooilley yn stoo-thie faagit dy beagh peiagh ennagh er n’aagail ayns driss mooar bleeantyn er dy henney.,There were very big trees and very thick plants and bushes; after a while we found a ruin of a wooden shack and inside all the houshold things were left as if someone would have left in a great hurry many years ago.,
"Va claareeyn er y voayrd as fritlagyn-eaddee croghey er y voalley. Cheumooie, cooyl y thie, va bwaane beg as coirrey-aile ry lhiattee (sauna bath?).","There were plates on the table and rags of cloth hanging on the wall. Outside, behind the house, there was a small shed with a fire-furnace by the side (a sauna bath?).",
"Dooyrt Juan, gyn dooyt va’n boayl bentyn da Finlandee, ronsaghey as reurey son airh ’sy tourey as tayrtyn cretooryn feie son nyn grackanyn ayns y gheurey.","John said, no doubt the place was belonging to Finns, searching and digging for gold in the Summer and catching wild creatures for their skins in the winter.",
"Hie shin beggan ny sodjey ’sy cheyll as hooar shin oaie, va crosh fuygh er agh gyn ennym erbee er.","We went a little further in the woods and we found a grave, there was a wooden cross on it, but without any name on it.",
Nish va shin er n’gheddyn folliaght!,Now we had found a mystery!,
Quoi by lesh y corp ’syn oaie? Ren y fer geddyn baase dy dooghyssagh ny dyn?,Who owned the body in the grave? Did the fellow die naturally or not?,
"Foddee v’eh er ny varroo ayns drogh-haghyrt,[1] as foddee dy duitt ad magh as va’n derrey yeh er ny varroo ec y jeh elley, quoi ec ta fys?","Maybe he was killed in a accident, and maybe they fell out and the one had killed the other, who knows?","[1] drogh-haghyrt] ‘mischief’ or ‘misfortune’ in Classical Manx, often ‘accident’ in 20C L2 Manx.  "
Cha jagh shin ny sodjey as hyndaa shin er-ash gys y finneig.,We didn’t go further and we turned back to the canoe.,
"Va Juan Comish gollrish Injinagh, mie-ynsit ayns keird-cheylley as cretooryn feie ny keylley, as un laa myr va shin shiaulley dy dree rish oirr ny logh, yeeagh eh dou ny loghyn beggey troggit ec ny dooar-choiyn (beavers) agh cha ren shin fakin ad gobbragh.","John Comish was like an Indian, well-learned in woodcraft and wild creature of the forest, and one day as we were sailing slowly by the side of the lake, he showed me the little lakes built by the beavers, but we didn’t see them working.",
Dooyrt Juan dy jinnagh shin goll magh ayns oie ry-hollys vooar heeagh shin ram jeu ec obbyr.,John said that if we were to go out in a well moonlit night we would see a lot of them at work.,
"V’ad shoh ny traaghyn bynney lhiam, dy ve my lomarcan marish Juan taggloo ry-cheilley ayns Gailck ayns fea as shee, as hie ny laghyn shaghey ro happee dooin.","These were the days I loved most, to be alone with John talking together in Manx in peace and quiet, and the days passed to quickly for us.",
"Fy yerrey haink y laa dooin dy gholl er-ash gys Kirkland Lake, as daag shin y cabbane ayns y keeiragh, as tra v’eh lane dorraghey choud as va shin foast troailt ayns y carr, honnick shin red ennagh nagh vaikyms reesht arragh!","Finally the day came for us to go back to Kirklanf Lake, and we left the cabin in the twilight, and when it was very dark whilst we were still travelling in the car, we saw something I will never see again!",
"“Lossan y Twoaie” (Aurora Borealis). Cre’n shilley aalin yindyssagh er-skyn insh! V’eh jeeaghyn dy ve bunnys er nyn skyn, curthan jeh dy chooilley chullyr jeh’n Goal-Twoaie, gleashagh as bennalt myr brattagh mooar ’sy speyr.","“The Northern Lights” (Aurora Borealis). What a beautiful, indescribably wonderful sight! It seemed to be almost above us, a curtain of every colour of the rainbow, moving and fluttering like a great flag in the sky.",
 Cha noddym feddyn fockleyn dy insh diu yn aalid jeh., I cannot find words to tell you the beauty of it.,
"Laa ny vairagh, daag mee Kirkland Lake er y train goll my-yiass, agh vrish mee ny yurnaa dy chur shilley er Niagara.","The next day, I laft Kirkland Lake on the train going South, but I broke-up my journey to see Niagra.",
"Va shen shilley yindyssagh neesht, agh er-lhiams nagh row eh dy ve cosoylit rish Lossan y Twoaie.","That was a wonderful sight too, but I think that it wasn’t to be compared to the Northern Lights.",
"Ta mee booiagh as booisal dy row y caa aym dy chur shilley er my charrey Juan Comish as e ven, as dy akin red ennagh jeh Ontario, agh va’n un thurrys dy liooar dooys, cha b’laik lhiam beaghey ayns y cheer shen.","I am pleased and grateful that I had the opportunity to visit my friend John Comish and his wife, and to see something of Ontario, but the one trip was enough for me, I wouldn’t like to live in that country.",
"Cha nel yindys orrym dy row lheid y foddeeaght er Juan ny yei Ellan Vannin, as s’treih lhiam nagh row rieau y caa echey dy heet thie reesht dys cheer e ghooie.","I’m not surprised that John had such homesickness for the Isle of Man, and I’m sorry that he never had the chance to come home again to his native country.",
"Cha row Juan Comish ny ghooinney berchagh, agh v’eh dy firrinagh Manninagh dooie doaieagh.","John Comish wasn’t a wealthy man, but he truly was a native, pleasant, Manxman.",
