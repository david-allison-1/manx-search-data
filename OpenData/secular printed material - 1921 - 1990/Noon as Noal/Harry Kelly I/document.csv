Ta sleih hannah er n’insh dou dy ghow ad soylley mooar ass y chied ayrn yn shiaghtin shoh chaie.,People have already told me that they greatly enjoyed the first part last week.,,,,

"Myr screeu Markys, she’n currym ain dy chur magh ayns clou ooilley ta ry-gheddyn mychione ny shenn ayraghyn ain, hymnee dooin yn cliejeen shen erskyn leagh, chengey ny mayrey Ellan Vannin.","As Mark wrote, it is our duty to publish in print all that is available concerning our ancestors to whom we will dedicate that priceless jewel, the mother tongue of the Isle of Man.",,,,

"Screeu yn Olloo Robert Mac Comysh, “She ny goan scruit ta tannaghtyn,” as she’n irriney v’echey.","Professor Robert Thomson wrote, “It is the written words that remain,” and that was the truth he had.",,,,
HARRY KELLY,HARRY KELLY,,,,
(goll er),(continuing),,,,
Ren eh gearey choud as v’eh jeeaghyn cour[1] y tholtan.,He smiled and he was looking towards the ruined house.,"[1] cour] [lesh], rather than [cour] is used elsewhere for ‘towards’.",,,
"     “Vel oo fakin y shenn ghooinney ayns shen? Ta Gaelg flaaoil echey,” dooyrt eh.","     “Do you see the old man there? He has fluent Manx,” he said.",,,,
" “T’eh goaill aggle mooar roish joarreeyn, agh trooid[2] marym, as hee mayd, son bee eh red scammyltagh my ta shiu er jeet voish Doolish dy gholl ersooyl dyn clashtyn fockle erbee.” "," “He is very afraid of strangers, but come with me, and we’ll see, because it will be a scandal if you have come from Douglas, to go away without hearing a single word.” ",[2] Trooid] ‘Come’ (imperative) is more commonly used to mean ‘Come (from there to here)’ as in the  the phrase [Trooid stiagh] ‘Come in.’ ‘Come’ in the sense of ‘Come (along with me)’ is more usually [Tar]. ,,,
"Hie shin marish sheese y bayr beg, raad, ec ooirr y bayr, va’n shenn ghooinney croymmit sheese ec[3] niee e laueyn ayns ammair chloaie.","We went with him down the lane, where at the edge of the lane, the old man was bent down washing his hands in a stone channel.",[3] ec] usage here appears to mimic the use of the particle ‘ag’ before a verbal noun in Scottish Gaelic.,,,
"     “Harry”, dooyrt nyn garrey noa, “ta’n dooinney aeg shoh er jeet voish Doolish dy chlashtyn paart dy Gaelg: son shickyr cha jean shiu eh y hyndaa ersooyl mollit.” ","     “Harry,” said our new friend, “this young man has come from Douglas to hear some Manx: surely you won’t turn him away disappointed.”",,,,
"     “Aw,” dooyrt Harry, “cha s’ayms.”","     “Aw,” said Harry, “I don’t know.”",,,,
     Eisht hass eh seose chirrymaghey e laueyn er lhiatteeyn e vreechen as yeeagh eh dy gyere orrym.,Then he stood up drying his hands on the sides of his britches and he looked sharply at me.,,,,
 “Cha nel agh paart dy focklyn ayms — te bunnys ooilley jarroodit ayms. , “I only have some words — I’ve forgotten nearly it all. ,,,,
Er aght erbee shegin dou goll thie dy yannoo aarloo cappan dy hey son Juan as Thobm nish.”,"Anyway, I must go home to get ready a cup of tea for Juan and Tom now.”",,,,
"     “Cum ort Harry,” dooyrt nyn garrey, “Cre’n driss t’ort? Abbyr red ennagh ta mee guee orts rish y dooinney aeg.”","     “Hold on Harry,” said our friend, “what’s your hurry? Say something I pray of you to the young man.”",,,,
"     Duirree Harry as dooyrt eh, “As ta shiu er jeet voish Doolish ghooinney aeg? Oh m’arrane[4] — ta shen raad liauyr — agh c’red t’ou laccal clashtyn?” ",     Harry waited and he said “And you have come from Douglas young man? Oh my song — that is a long way — but what do you want to hear?”,"[4] Oh m’arrane] ‘Oh my song’ — seems to be used here as English ‘Oh My Word!’, elsewhere unattested.",,,
"     “Red erbee, sailliu,” dooyrt mish.","     “Anything you please,” I said.",,,,
"     “Eaisht jee eisht,” dooyrt eh, as loayr eh Padjer y Chiarn ’sy Ghaelg. ","     “Listen then,” he said, and he spoke the Lord’s Prayer in Manx. ",,,,

","     I can’t say that a hearty invitation was given to me — indeed, no invitation at all was given to me, but I went back to Cregneash and by making a familiar spirit of myself Harry found that I had a keen desire to learn Manx, and after that was sorted there was a welcome before me any time I went to visit him.",,,,

"Ny sodjey, ec keayrtyn va’n earish ro fluigh ny ro garroo as cha row eh cooie dy gholl markaight er cabbyl yiarn, as shen y fa cha jagh mee.","Furthermore, sometimes the weather was too wet or too rough and it wasn’t suitable to riding on an ‘iron horse’ (bicycle / bike), and that’s why I didn’t go.",,,,
"Cha daink smooinaght rieau ayns my chione dy gheddyn cabbyl yiarn immanit liorish motor, as myr shen va ram caaghyn caillit aym.","The thought never occurred to me to get an ‘iron horse’ driven by a motor (motorbike), and so I had many missed opportunities.",,,,
Ta shoh er ve oyr dy hrimshey mooar dou ayns bleeantyn s’anmee.,This has been a cause of regret for me in later years.,,,,

Ayns y tourey shen chionnee mee aachlou Focklioar Cregeen voish Illiam Cubbon jeh’n Museum son daa skillin yeig. ,In that summer I bought a reprint of Cregeen’s dictionary from William Cubbon of the Museum for twelve shillings.,,,,
Va mish jeant magh.,I was satisfied.,,,,
Cre’n lioar yindyssagh.,What a wonderful book.,,,,
"Va ogher ayms nish, myr yein, dy osley dorrys theihll noa, as jirrym fegooish pyagh erbee gra m'oi dy row shoh yn kionnaght share va rieau ry-gheddyn son daa skillin yeig.","I had a key now, to open the door of a new world, and I’ll say without anyone contradicting me that this was the best purchase that was ever got for twelve shillings.",,,,
     Lesh cooney y Focklioar va’n Gaelg ayms cheet er y hoshiaght.,     With the help of the dictionary my Manx was progressing.,,,,
"Va Harry ny fer ynsee jeidagh as mie, as va mee my ynseydagh arryltagh.","Harry was an diligent and good teacher, and I was a willing learner.",,,,
"V’eh loayrt Gaelg rhyms ooilley’n traa, ayns e hie[6], er ny bayryn, er ny cassanyn as ayns ny magheryn.","He was speaking Manx to me all the time, in his house, on the roads, on the paths and in the fields.",[6] ayns e hie] text gives ‘ayns y hie’. ,,,
"S’treih lhiam gra nagh row traa ny smoo[7] ceaut ayms ayns Cregneash geaishtagh rish, as traa ny sloo ceaut ayms er y vagher bluggan cass, as jummalit er fardailysyn elley.","I’m sorry to say more time wan’t spent in Cregneash listening to him, and less time spent on the football field, and wasted on other foolish things.",[7] traa ny smoo— in Classical Manx [traa sodjey] would be expected for ‘more time’. In late 19thC Manx [ny smoo] was used as a catch-all translation of ‘more’ and its usage here is consistant consistant with that usage.,,,
S’creeney ta shin tra te ro anmagh.,How wise we are when it is too late.,,,,
     Oie dy row va mee ayns thie Harry as va kiare deiney elley ayns shen.,     One night I was in Harry’s house and there were four other men there.,,,,
V’ad ooilley e nabooyn as she ooilley Gaelg v’ad loayrt.,They were all his neighbours and it was all Manx they were talking.,,,,
"Hoie mee ayns chorneil, cha feagh as lugh, screeu sheese cha wheesh as voddin[8].","I sat in the corner, as quiet as a mouse, writing down as much as I could.","[8] In the test [cha wheesh as] is repeated in error. ‘cha voddin’ — ‘I could’ is the conditional tense form, not the simple past — although this usage agrees with the writing of Ned Beg Hom Ruy (also from Cregneash).",,,
"Lurg roshtyn my hie hene, bunnys ec munoie, myr ve oayllagh dou, hoie mee sheese ec y voayrd, yn Focklioar ec my lhiattee dy reaghey magh ny screeunyn jeant ayms, as va jannoo yindys mooar orrym dy feddyn magh son sambyl, dy row “lal” (myr cheayll mee yn ockle[9]) ayns Focklioar Cregeen fo’n chummey kiart “laccal”, “smun-yin” fo “smooinaghtyn” as dy row “raw harvey” “ro happee”.","After arriving at my own house, almost at midnight, as was usual for me, I sat down at the table, the Dictionary at my side, to sort out the writing I’d done, and I was surprised to discover for example, that “lal” (as I heard the word) in Cregeen’s Dictionary was under the correct form “laccal”, “smun-yin” under “smooinaghtyn” and that  “raw harvey” was “ro happee”.",[9] yn ’ockle] [yn fockle] would be expected here.,,,

[bioys] usually means ‘life’ in the sense of ‘life-force’. ‘Of his life’ in the sense of ‘of his experience of living’ is usually [jeh’n vea echey].,,,
