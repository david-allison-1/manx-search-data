","I had already been in Egypt and to the Black Sea for queig voyages and I was tired of looking at the filthy, lousy Egyptians and their diseased eyes, and I was tired too, watching the discord and nonsense, hunger and misery in Russia — in Batoum, Poti, Nickolaiev, and Odessa, and in the last place I saw, “The Bloody Stairs” where the “Great Murder” had been committed in the little uprising in 1905. ","[3] Batoum] Batumi, Georgia.
[4] Nickolaiev] Mykolaiv, Ukraine.
[5] “The Bloody Stairs” — The Primorsky Stairs (aka. The Potemkin Stairs). A stairway of 200 stairs leading from the port to the city of Odesa, Ukraine. During the 1905 Uprising, Tsarist troops fought with mutinous sailors and many civilians died, in a famous scene in the film “The Battleship Potemkin” (1925) civilians are killed by Tsarist troops on these stairs. There was also a violent pogrom in Odesa in 1905. However, Comish may not be referring to historical events as elswhere he uses [fuiltagh] ‘bloody’ as a swear word, and may simply be showing how he felt about climbing the stairs."
"Yn Roosh Chasherick, ny Yn Roosh Anjeeagh, cheer neuvaynrey dy jarroo!

However, in Manx [yn Niar] is often used as a catch-all term for ‘The East’. "
