Yarrood mee dy chur ennym Yuan y Geill fo’n skeeal beg mychione Bnr. Cubbon Jesarn shoh chaie.,I forgot to put John Gell’s name under the little story about Mrs Cubbon last Saturday.,
B’leshyn y skeeal as er hoh tooilley fys diu er yn shenn sleih yn shiaghtin shoh voish nyn garrey Juan reesht.,The story was by him and here is more information for you about the old people this week from our friend John again.,
"Ta mee er chlashtyn sleih gra nagh vel ad laccal rour dy skeeallyn mychione y shenn sleih as myrgeddin nagh vel ad laccal monney skeeallyn ass ny cheeraghyn Gaelgagh elley dy ve ry-akin ayns “Noon as Noal” agh myr screeu mee roie, nish yn caa oc shid dy screeu red ennagh ad hene as beeym feer wooiagh dy chur magh ayns clou yn screeuyn oc!","I have heard people say that they don’t want too many stories about the old people and also that they don’t want stories from the other Celtic countries to appear in “Noon as Noal”, but as I wrote before, now is their chance to write something themselves and I will be very pleased to publish their letters in print!",
Er my hon hene ta lettyraght (literature) ny cheeraghyn Gaelgagh elley yn lettyraght ain hene myrgeddin. Nagh vel shin ooilley jeh’n un chynney as mooinjerys eddyr ain as y ghlare cheddin ain?,"In my opinion, literature of the other Celtic countries is our literature too. Aren’t we all from the same kin with a relationship between us and our common language?",

Foddee dy vaik shiu caslys ayns y colloo “Noon as Noal” jeh Ned Maddrell marish “An Taoiseach” Eamon De Valera ec thie Harry Kelly ec Creneash?,Maybe you saw a picture in the column “Noon as Noal” of Ned Maddrell with “An Taoiseach” Eamon De Valera at Harry Kelly’s house at Cregneash?,
"B’leayr da De Valera dy row y Ghailck ghooghyssagh Vannin geddyn baase, as lhisagh red ennagh ve jeant ’sy chooish.","It was clear to De Valera that the native Manx of the Isle of Man was dying, and that something ought to be done in the matter.",
"Eisht ’sy nah vlein 1948, haink Sean O’Sullivan as Kevin Danahar veih’n “Irish Folklore Com­mission” ayns Divlin, marish van-motor as ooilley ny greienyn aynsyn da yannoo recortyssyn jeh ooilley ny shenn Vanninee ’syn Ellan as Gailck vie oc.","Then in the next year, 1948, Sean O’Sullivan and Kevin Danahar came from the “Irish Folklore Commission” in Dublin, with a van and all the equipment in it to make recordings of the old Manx people in the Island with good Manx.",
"Va Sean as Kevin goaill aaght ec y thie ain ec Port le Moirrey as lurg va’n obbyr jeant, dooyrt ad rhym, “Vel oo shickyr nish nagh vel peiagh erbee elley?”","Sean and Kevin were lodging at our house at Port St Mary and after the work was done, they said to me, “Are you sure now that there isn’t anyone else?”",
"     Dreggyr mee, “Well, ta dooinney ayns Balley Beg as Gailck dy liooar echey, agh cha jean eh loayrt ee.","I answered, “Well, there’s a man in Balley Beg and he knows plenty of Manx, but he won’t speak it.",
"Shimmey keayrt ta mee er n’gholl dys e hie, agh cha jean eh loayrt Gailck er chor erbee, agh keayrt ny ghaa ta mee er hroailt er y barroose marish Johnnie oie Jesarn as eshyn lieh-scoorit.","Many a time I’ve gone to his house, but he won't speak Manx at all, but once or twice I have travelled on the bus with Johnnie on a Saturday night while he was half-drunk.",
"Eisht yinnagh eh loayrt Gailck marym veih Balley Chashtal gys y keirdee ec Balley Beg, gyn fockle dy Vaarle.”","Then he would speak Manx with me from Castletown to the smithy at Balley Beg, without a word of English.”",
" “Och,” dooyrt Ny Yernee, “My vees bine dy lhune feaysley e hengey, cre yinnagh boteil dy ushtey-bea? ","      “Och,” said the Irishmen, “If a drop of ale will loosen his tongue, what would a bottle of whisky do? ",
Ta boteil jeh’n stoo creoie Yernagh marin. Lhig dooin goll as cur shilley er y vitchoor as miolagh eh lesh.”,We have a bottle of the Irish hard-stuff with us. Let’s go and see the rogue and tempt him with it.”,

"     Va mee gyndys cre’n oyr v’eh cho wooiagh dy veeiteil rish joarreeyn, as eisht smooinee mee, foddee dy vel eh er nakin y voteil ec Sean!","     I was wondering why he was so pleased to meet strangers, and then I thought, maybe he has seen Sean’s bottle!",

"     Ec y traa shoh va mee gaase corree as dooyrt mee ’sy Ghailck, “Ta breag ayns dty veeal Yuan, ta palchey Gailck ayd oie Jesarn tra vees bine dy yough aynyd cheet thie voish Balley Chashtal.","     At this point I was growing angry and I said in Manx, “There’s a lie in your mouth John, you know plenty of Manx on Saturday night when there’s a drop of drink in you, coming home from Castletown.",
Ta ny deiney shoh er jeet veih Nherin dy chlashtyn rish y Ghailck as er chur lhieu bine dy ushtey-bea Yernagh. ,These men have come from Ireland to hear Manx and have brought a drop of Irish whiskey. ,
Nagh Jean oo loayrt marym ’sy Ghailck son jough y lheid shen?”,Won’t you speak with them in Manx for a such drink as that?”,

"Cha dooyrt eh veg, agh hayrn eh y voteil huggey lesh daa laue, as chum eh urree!","He didn’t say anything, but he drew the bottle to himself with two hands, and he held it!",
Y chenn chimmagh croutagh!,The old crafty rogue!,
"Fy-yerrey b’leayr dooin dy row shin dy firrinagh jummal nyn draa as haink shin ersooyl gyn fockle dy Ghailck voish, agh hooar Johnnie y voteil dy ushtey-bea! ","At last it was clear to us that we were truly wasting our time and we came away without a word of Manx from him, but Johnny got the bottle of whisky! ",
Row rieau dooinney cho sturneishagh as kialgagh?,Was there ever a man so stubborn and tricky!,
"Ta mee cra’al[1] dy row Jamys Karran, Creneash, ny Vanninagh dooie as Gailck dy liooar echey, agh gollrish Johnnie Cubbon cha jinnagh eh loayrt ee.","I believe that James Karran of Cregneash was a true Manxman who had plenty of Manx, but like Johnny Cubbon he wouldn’t speak it.",[1] cra’al] evidently [credjal] ‘believing’ with spelling indicative of pronunciation. 
"Dooyrt “Breagagh” ayns y colloo “Noon as Noal”, 15/1/77, “ga dy row Gaelg yindyssagh echey, cha jinnagh eh loayrt assjee edyr. "," “Breagagh” said in the column “Noon as Noal”, 15/1/77, “although he had wonderful Manx, he wouldn’t speak in it at all. ",
"Tra loayragh shin ayns Gaelg rishyn, yinnagh eh freggyrt ass y Vaarle.”","When we would speak Manx to him, he would answer in English.”",

"Va mee er chlashtyn mychione eck dy mennick er y fa dy row ee ben-vooinjerey da my Yishag Mooar (Evan Crebbin) as Ned Maddrell as Tom Karran, ooilley clein “Yn Chenn Pheiagh” voish Yn Howe.","I had heard about her often because she was a relative of my Grandfather (Evan Crebbin) and Ned Maddrell and Tom Karran, all descendents of “The Old Person” from The Howe.",

Breagagh,Breagagh,
Jack Maddrell (Braa ny saa da Ned)[3],Jack Maddrell (Younger Brother to Ned),"[3] Braa ny saa da Ned] ‘Younger brother to Ned’. As the phrase is not accompanied by the verb [ve] ‘to be’ the expected phrase for ‘younger brother’ would be [braar saa]. The use of [da] in this context usually used for non-family relationships, such as [carrey da] ‘a friend of’. The expected phrase here would be [Braa saa Ned] ‘Ned’s younger brother’ / ‘a young brother of Ned’. "
"Va Gailck vie ec Jack Maddrell, co-chorrym rish e vraar Ned, agh gollrish ymmodee Manninee jeh'n sheeloghe echey, cha ren eh soiaghey mooar jeh chengey ny mayrey.","Jack Maddrell knew Manx well, equal to his brother ned, but like many Manx people of his generation, he never thought much of the mother tongue.",
"Ny yeih, v’eh dy kinjagh kenjal dooys as choud's loayr mish ’sy Ghailck rish, yinnagh Jack taggloo rhyms ’sy Ghailck neesht, agh er-lhiams nagh row jeeanid ec Jack er e son, as cha geayll mee rieau Jack gra, gollrish e vraar Ned, “T’eh jannoo foays da my chree clashtyn ee.”","Nevertheless, he was always kind to me and whilst I spoke in Manx to him, Jack would talk to me in Manx too, but I think he didn't have zeal for it, and I never heard Jack say, like his brother Ned, “It lifts my spirits hearing it.”",
Car ny bleeantyn Caggee va Jack as Ned ayns yn “Auxiliary Coast Guard” as va cabbane fuygh er nyn son er bun challoo Phurt Noo Moirrey.,"During the war years Jack and Ned were in the Auxiliary Coast Guard, and there was a wooden cabin for them on the bottom of Port St Mary breakwater.",
"Ny keayrtyn raghin dys shen oie gheuree dy gheddyn y Ghailck veue, as dy mennick veagh deiney elley maroo jannoo gannidys as gamman er y Ghailck gra nagh row Jack as Ned loayrt ee dy kiart!","Sometimes I would go there on a winter night to get Manx from them, and there would often be other men with them mocking and making fun of Manx saying that Jack and Ned didn't speak it correctly!",
"Eisht veagh focklyn ard as arganeys ayn, agh v’eh ooilley jeant ayns gien mie as dy cadjin yiarragh Ned red ennagh gollrish shoh,","Then there would be loud words and argument, but it was all done in good humour and often Ned would say something like this;",
"“Aw, jeigh dty ghob mooar, cha row rieau fockle kiart dy Ghailck ass y veeal ayd hene ansherbee,” as veagh Jackie garraghtee dy ard.","“Oh, shut your big beak, there has never been a correct word of Manx out of your own mouth anyway,” and Jackie would laugh out loud.",
"Dooyrt Mark Braide dy row eh screeu sheese y Ghailck cheayll eh voish Harry kiart myr v'eh clashtyn ee, as ny s’anmee kiartagh ee voish y Focklioar.","Mark Braide said that he wrote down the Manx he heard from Harry just as he was hearing it, and later corrected it from the dictionary.",
"O, dy beigns er n’yannoo yn lheid cheddin, ta my chooinaghtyn failleil nish as ta mooarane ny Ghailck cheayll mee bleeantyn er dy henney jarroodit aym.","Oh, if I had only done the same thing, my memory is failing now and there is a lot of Manx that I heard years ago that I have forgotten.",

Hug ee keead milley failt roin as by vie lhee geddyn naight jeh Elian Vannin.","Jack Maddrell was married to a woman from Kinsale, and when I and my first wife and daughter were travelling in Ireland in the year 1951, we visited Mrs Newman, sister-in-law to Jack, She gave us a ‘céad míle fáilte’ and she liked getting news from the Isle of Man.",
"By gooin lh’ee ym­modee jeh ny Manninee aegey boayllagh cheet gys Kinsale dy eeastagh brick-varrey ayns laghyn e h-aegid, as dimraa ee kuse jeu er ennym.

"Eisht ghow mee aittys vooar tra vrie ee orrym lesh gearey as lieh-sannish, “Crenaght ta Plucky Ned?” as eisht v'ee garraghtee dy ard!","Then I ‘took great fun’ (thought it very funny) when she asked me with a smile and a half-whisper, “How is Plucky Ned?” and then she was laughing out loud!",
"Va daa ’neen eck, as ’syn astyr yeeagh ad dooin y valley as y Phurt Kinsale.","     She had two daughters, and in the afternoon they would show us the town and Port of Kinsale.",

"Nish, foddee dy vel Kinsale myr Purt le Moirrey reesht, lane dy vaatyn veggey, lhuingys-eunys son ny cummaltee noa berchagh, as ghaa ny tree baatyn eeastee roagan.","Now, maybe Kinsale is like Port St Mary again, full of little boats, a pleasure fleet for the rich new residents, and two or three scallop fishing boats. ",
"Honnick mee ny lhie er y cheiy ec Kinsale skarrag feer vooar, ceaut ersooyl ec eeasteyr ennagh, foddee dy row palchey eeast elley ny share echey?","I saw, lying on the quay at Kinsale, a very large skate, thrown away by some fisherman, maybe he had plenty of other better fish?",
"Aghterbee, ta mee shickyr nagh beagh skarrag y lheid shen er ny yummal jiu edyr.","Anyway, I am sure there wouldn’t be such a skate wasted today, at all.",
