"Va mish ny yoarree da gollrish Sostnagh, as cha row monney Gailck aym noadyr, as va’n veggan ayms er ve ynsit ass lioaryn","I was a stranger to him like an Englishman, and I didn’t know much manx either, and the very little I had had been learnt from books. ",
. Hooar mee magh dy leah nagh row blass ny Gailck ayms kiart!,I found out soon that the Manx accent I had wasn’t correct.,
"Aghterbee, va Ned feer foddey-hurransagh marym as fy-yerrey oddysmayd jannoo co-loayrtys beg ’sy Ghailck.","Anyway, Ned was very long-suffering with me and finally we could make a small conversation in Manx.",

" “Ta,” dreggyr mee, “Va W. H. Gell, Purt le Moirrey braar my ayrey as ta Harry Collister, masoonagh, poost rish shuyr my ayrey.”"," “Yes,” I answered, “W. H. Gell, Port St Mary, was my father’s brother and Harry Collister, mason, is married to my father’s sister.”",
Va shen dy liooar! Va mee my Vanninagh! Eisht ghow toshiaght caarjys firrinagh ren tannaghtyn rish shey bleeantyn jeig as feed!,That was enough! I was a Manxman! Then I started a true friendship that remained for thirty-six years!,
"S’cooin lhiam Ned briaght jeem, “Cre’n eash t’ou?”","I remember Ned asking me, “What age are you?”",
"Nish cha dod mee coontey feer vie ayns Gailck ec y traa shen as dreggyr mee, “Ta mee bunnys daeed.”","Now I couldn’t count very well in Manx at that time and I answered, “I am almost forty.”",
" “Daeed?” dooyrt Ned, “Cha nel oo jeeaghyn shen edyr.” ","“Forty?” said Ned, “you don’t look that, at all.” ",
"Eisht dooyrt mee, “S’feer eh, va mee ruggit mysh y traa vrish magh y Caggey Boeragh ayns Africa.”","Then I said, “It’s true, I was born about the time when the Boer War broke out in Africa.”",
"Traa erbee va mee er yn Ellan, yinnins my raad gys thie Ned ec Glion Chiass.","Any time I was on the Island, I would make my way to Ned’s house at Glen Chass.",

Va Ned trimshagh ec y traa shen as cha row eh son[1] loayrt monney Gailck.,Ned was sad at that time and he wasn’t wanting to speak much Manx.,"[1] son] In the writing of Ned Beg Hom Ruy and the recordings of native speakers [son] is used to mean ‘can’. However, L2 speakers and writers tend to use it to mean ‘for’, as in ‘in favour of’, or ‘wanting to’."
"V’eh smooinaght dy beagh Edard rey rish y cheayn, agh va cree dunnal yindyssagh ec y ghuilley as fy-yerrey v’eh shiaulley reesht as haink eh dy ve ny chaptan er e vaatey hene.","He was thinking that Edward would be done with the sea, but the boy had a wonderfully courageous character and at last he was sailing again, and he became a captain on his own boat.",

Lhig dou ginsh dhyt, ta shin nyn Vanninee as ta shin loayrt ass chengey ny mayrey Ellan Vannin, as ta shin goaill moyrn j’ee.","Straight away Ned jumped up with rage and he said in English to the Englishman, “Nonsense is it? Let me tell you, we are Manx and we speak and are speaking the mother tongue of the Isle of Man, and we are proud of it.",
S'cummey lhien c’red t’ou uss coontey j’ee.,We don’t care what you reckon of it.,
"Mannagh liak lhiat ee, gyn dooyt ta palchey reamys er dty hon ayns carriadge elley!”","If you don’t like it, no doubt there’s plenty of room for you in another carriage!”",
"Va mish gearey as smooinaghtyn rhym-pene, nish ta fys aym cre’n fa va’n far-ennym “Plucky Ned” currit da.","I was smiling and thinking to myself, now I know why the nickname “Plucky Ned” was given to him.",

"Hug Ned enn dou er Neddy Crebbin as Benr. Eleanor Karran ayns Creneash as va Gailck vie ocksyn neesht, agh ta shen skeeal elley.","Ned introduced me to Neddy Crebbin and Mrs. Eleanor Karran in Cregneash and they had good Manx too, but that is another story.",
