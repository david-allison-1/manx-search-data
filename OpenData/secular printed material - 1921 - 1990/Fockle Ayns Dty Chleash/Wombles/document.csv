Manx,English,Notes
TA MEE er n’ghoaill ayns laue dy screeu[1] yn colloo shoh ry-hoi yn rollage Vanninagh dagh shiaghtin. ,I hae decided to write this column for The Manx Star each week.,[1] dy screeu] text gives [dy creeu]
"Cha noddym gra dy bee yn Ghailck aym dy kinjagh kiart ny aalin, agh ec y chooid sloo bee eh foym screeu yn naight.","I can’t say that the Manx will always be correct or beautiful, but at the least, I will intend to write the news.",
Ta fys eu er yn naight eddyr-ashoonagh hannah voish yn radio ny chellveeish as ta fys eu er yn naight Vanninagh hannah ansherbee.,You know the international news already from the radio or television and you know the Manx news anyway.,
"Myr shen, bee yn colloo shoh ny phoagey-fritlagh jeh boghtanys[2], gollrish joan-choyr[3], as foddee shiu teiy as reih ayn myr s’mie lhiu.","So, this column will be a ragbag of rubbish, like a dustbin, and you can pick and choose in it as you like.","[2] boghtanys] — text gives [boghlanys]. ‘misery’ (in Phillips’ Psalms (1610).‘Rubbish’ or ‘nonsense’ is more commonly translated as [ommijys], or [boghtynid] (perhaps the intended word here).
[3] joan-choyr] a calque of the English ‘dust-bin’ (the usual term for which is [coyr-trustyr]), using a ‘head word first’ as might be found in Irish."
   Foddee dy bee paart jiu er n’akin yn colloo ayns Yn Chaghter Vona yn shiaghtin shoh chaie mychione yn eie dy chur lesh kuse dy “Wombles” stiagh ayns yn ellan voish Sostyn.,     Maybe some of you have seen the column in Mona’s Herald this past week about the idea of bringing a few Wombles into the island from England.,
  T’eh jeeaghyn dy vel yn Chooinseil Valjey dy Ghoolish bwoirit mychione yn boghtanys[4] skeayllit ayns ny straaidjyn. Agh cre’n oyr er y theill lhisagh ad cur lhieu stiagh “Wombles”? , It seems that the Town Council of Douglas is bothered about the rubbish spread in the streets. But why in the world should they bring in Wombles?  ,[4] boghtanys] ‘misery’ (in Phillips’ Psalms (1610).(text gives [boghlanys]). ‘Rubbish’ in the sense of ‘litter’ is more commonly translated as [trustyr] or [smooirlagh].
"Gollrish dagh ooilley nhee Sostnagh, ta “Wombles” nyn groo noa as she troar jeh ardveenid aaghowin[5] as neuheilltynagh[6] t’ad.","Like everything English, Wombles are a new creation, and they are a product of a shallow and unimaginative civilisation.","[5] aaghowin] ‘shallow’. This is an unusal choice of word for shallow. The [aa] prefix before [dowin] ‘deep’ usually carries the meaning of English ‘re’, as in ‘reapply’.
[6] neuheilltynagh] ‘unimaginative’ —seems to be based on [sheiltyn] for which Cregeen gives ‘supposing, conjecturing, thinking’."
"     “Wombles”, my chass[7]! Nagh vel enn ec yn Chooinseil er Phynnoddereeghyn[8].","     Wombles, my foot! Doesn’t the Council recognise Phynnodderees?","[7] my chass] ‘my foot’, but here it used as a calque on the English idiomatic interjection ‘X my foot!’ (in more current English ‘ x, my ass’ or ‘x my hat’). 
[8] phynnodderee] ‘a sprite, etc.’ the expected plural form would be [phynodderreeyn].
"
Neayr’s traaghyn roie-hendeeagh ta ny Phynnoddereeghyn er ve nyn gaarjyn da yn sleih-Manninagh.,Since prehistoric times the Phynnodderees have been friends to the Manx people.,
As t’ad foast baghey ayns Glion Ruy as erskyn Dalby.,And they are still living in Glen Roy and above Dalby.,
(Ny keayrtyn ta mee clashtyn ad tra ta mee gimman my ghleashtan er ny sleityn faggys da Corneil Gheayeeagh[9]).,(Sometimes I hear them when I’m driving my car on the mountains near to Windy Corner).,"[9] Corneil Gheeayeeagh] ‘Windy Corner’. [Yn Corneil Geayagh] ‘The Corner of Wind’, or [Yn Corneil Geayagh] ‘The Windy Corner’ would be the expected ways to Manxify ‘Windy Corner’."
  Lhig dooin shirrey er ny Phynnoddereeghyn dy heet neose as cur cooney dooin.,  Let’s ask the Phynnodderees to come down and give us help. ,
Ersooyl lesh ny beishtyn Sostnagh quaagh!,Away with the strange English beasts!,
"     Gyn ouyrys, bee shiu er lhaih ayns yn Emshir Shiaghtinoil Ellan Vannin dy daink yn aagherrid “O.K.” ass yn Ghailck “Ooilley Kiart”. ","     No doubt, you have read in the Isle of Man Weekly Times that the abreviation “O.K.” came from the Manx “Ooilley Kiart” (All Correct). ",
Vel fys ec peiagh erbee er aagherridyn erbee elley ren cheet ass y Ghailck?,Does anyone know about any other abbreviations that came from Manx?,
