"     Fastyr Jerdein shoh chaie, 21. I. 54; va shin g’eaishtaght rish y costreeu eddyr-scoill er y radio, ta enmyssit “Top of the Form,” as cheayll shin lesh taityns mooar dy row ny guillyn veih’n “Nicholson Institute,” (yn ard-scoill ’syn Eilean Leodhas) er chosney yn varriaght harrish ooilley ny scoillyn elley ayns Sostyn, n’Erin, as y thalloo Vretnagh.","     On Friday evening last, 21. I. 54; we were listening to the inter-school competition on the radio, that is called “Top of the Form”, and we herard with great delight that the boys from the Nicholson Institute, (the highschool in the Isle of Lewis) had achieved victory over all the other schools in England, Ireland and Wales.",
"Ta shinyn goaill moyrn ass nyn mraaraghyn aegey Gailckagh, as ta shin cur daue ard-voylley ’sy chooish ren ad cooilleeney cho mie.","We are ‘taking pride from’ (proud of / celebrating) our young Gaelic brothers, and we are sending them congratulations in the (for the) cause that they achieved so well.",
"Lhig dooin co-gherjaghey[1] maroo as marish ny fir-ynsee oc, as cur nyn mwooise daue dy vel ad er yeeaghyn da’n theihil nagh vel adsyn ta troggit as ynsit chammah ’sy Ghailck as ’sy Vaarle cooid veg ny s’melley na sleih elley ta toiggal Baarle ny lomarcan.","Let’s mutually support them and their teachers, and give them gratitiude that they have shown to the world that those who are raised and educated both in Gaelic and English are not any amount worse than other people who only understand English.","[1] co-gherjaghey maroo] seems to be a new phrase, consisting of [gerjaghey] ‘cheering up’, ‘comforting’ and the prefix [co-] ‘ associate’, ‘brother’, ‘combined’, ‘co’-, ‘con-‘, ‘constituent’, ‘mutual’, ‘mutually’, ‘sister’ (which does not seem to come before a verb before the 20th C) and [maroo] ‘together with them’. Here taken to mean ‘mutually support them’."
"S’mennick ta shin clashtyn fer gra “chan ’eeu ta’n Ghailck, as eshyn ta troggit ’sy Ghailck roish g’ynsagh y Vaarle, hurrys eh lhiettrymys nagh lhiggys da rieau corrymid marish e vraaraghyn troggit seose sy Vaarle.”","Often we hear (some)one say “Gaelic isn’t worthy, and anyone who is raised in Gaelic before learning English (has) suffered an impediment that will never allow them equaliy with his brothers raised up in English.”",
"Ta’n chooish shoh cur y breag orroo; dy jarroo firrinagh, ta ny guillyn Stornoway er reayll seose goo-mie ny Gael: yn Gael va rieau onneragh. jeidagh as tushtagh, ayns fockle—t’eshyn “sollan ny thallooin.”","This case ‘put’s the lie on them’ (shows that their opinion is flase); truly indeed, the Stornoway boys have kept up the good reputation of the Gaels: the Gael who was always honourable, modern and knowledgeable, in a word — he is “the salt of the earth.”",

"S’mie ta shiu er n’yannoo, y ghuillyn!","How well you have done, boys!",
     She orrin dy chur fys er “Yr Urdd Gobaith Cymru quoi ta goll gys y “Gwersyll Ceiltaidd” (y Cohagglym Ceilteagh) ec Pantyfedwen Boeth er y Chaisht (Avril 13-22).,     We have to let “Yr Urdd Gobaith Cymru” know who is going to the “Gwersyll Ceiltaidd” (The Celtic Congress) at Pantyfedwen Boeth at Easter (April 13 – 21).,
"     Streih lhein clashtyn nagh row Mnr. Karran abyl dy gheddyn sheese dys y vrashtyl Straaid Ridgeway, agh cha row eh ayns slaynt vie — ta shin jerkal rish fakin oo dy gherrid!","     We are sorry to hear that Mr. Karran was not able to get down to the Ridgeway Street class, but he wasn’t in good health — we expect (hope) to see you soon!",
"     Lhishagh shin ooilley screeu sheese dy chooilley skeeal ry clashtyn veih’n shenn sleih, chammah sy Ghailck, as y Vaarle, er yn oyr nagh vees caa ain dy gheddyn yn lheid lurg tammylt. ","     We all ought to write down every story to be heard from the old people, both in Manx , and English, because we won’t have a chance to get such after a while.",
