","I myself think that it wasn’t suitable to say all that he said, but I’m sorry to say that some of his story was the truth, and we all have to do our best to change many bad things that go on in the summer, but I am sure that it wasn only an accident that effected him, anyone is able to come across such as he found anywhere in this earthly world.",
She bastagh dy dooar eh lheid y boirey.,It is a pity that he found such trouble.,
