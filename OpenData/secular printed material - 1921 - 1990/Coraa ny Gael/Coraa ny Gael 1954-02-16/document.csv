","We have been giving praise to people who speak Manx, and it would be right for us to do that, but let us praise those that keep the customs (traditions) of the old days.",
"B’laick lhiam cur booise da “Mnr. Thomas Kinnish, St. George’s Street'” son croghey yn “Thammag Paagey” jeant dy hibbin, hollan, mess, as lughee dy shuggyr. Va’n lheid y shoh jeant ec y thie ainyn tra va mee my ghuilley aeg.","I would like to give thanks to Mr. Thomas Kinnish of Bridge Street, for hanging the “Kissing Bush” made of ivy, holly, fruit, and sugar mice. Such a thing was made at our house when I was a young boy.",

"Va ram skeealyn mie ry-chlashtyn, as hug eh boggey mooar orrin dy chlashtyn yn Gaelg yindyssagh t’echey.","There were many good stories to be heard, and it was a cause of great joy to us to hear the wonderful Manx he has.",

Owen O’ Farrelly, Cork, as ymoddee elley ass Erin.","We know well, and indeed, know personally the people in this island, but now we have to count (on) people who aren’t on this Island, namely:— Dr. Kavannah of Cork University; An Seabhac[1]; Oscar MacUiles, M. A., Dalky; Kevin Danachaire, Bealeodeas Eireann (Irish Folklore Commission); Owen O’ Farrelly, Cork, and many more from Ireland.",[1] An Seabhac] pen name of West Kerry author Pádraig Ó Siochfhradha. {An Seabhac} means ‘The Hawk’ in Irish.

S. B. Davies, Mochdu, Colwyn Bay, he who has written the book “Skeealyn Cheeil Chiollee,” and now we are coming to the mighty man, namely, Thomas Mac Nichol {??}, Newcastle upon Tyne, and I think that this great man writes in Manx almost every week.",
"T’eh n’jannoo obbyr mie tra t’eh chyndaa chammah “Albineas,” as “Erineas” stiagh ’sy Gaelg ainyn. ",He’s doing a good job when he translates both “Scottish (Gaelic)” and “Irish” into our Manx.,

"Cre’n fa nagh vel shin screeu hug sheshaghtyn Gaelgagh chammah ayns Erin as Albin as pabyryn Vretnagh, shirrey er sleih lesh Gaelg oc dy heet son laaghyn failley ny vud ain?","Why don’t we write to the Gaelic societies both in Ireland and Scotland and Welsh newspapers, asking people who know Gaelic to come for holidays amongst us?",
