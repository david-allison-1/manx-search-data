Va ram dy leih ec yn oanluckey sy Cheeill ny Skeelley Pherrick. ,There were many people at the burial in the Church of Patrick Parish.,
"Daag yn charbyd veih Delby ec nane er y clag moghree[1], as va sherveish ayns y Cheeill ny skeerey Pherrick.","The hearse left from Dalby at one o’ clock in the morning, and there was a service in the Church of Patrick Parish.",[1] nane er y clag moghree] ‘one o’clock in the morning’ — [nane] ‘one’ here is evidently a typo for [nuy] ‘nine’.
"Ta shin er choayl carrey elley, as t’ad gaase ny s’goan, agh booise da Jee, ta ram sleih aeg cheet er dy loayrt Gaelg, as ga nagh vel ad cho mie as adsyn ta er loayrt yn chengey veih nyn aegid, t’ad cur cree noa dooinyn ta gaase ny shinney.","We have lost another good friend, and they are becoming more scarce, but thanks to God, there are many young people coming on to speak Manx, and although they are not as good as those who have spoken the language from their youth, they give new encouragement to we who are growing older.",
"T’ad shoh ta shin jerkal rish fakin goaill yn ayrn smoo ayns reddyn Gaelgagh, as ta mee shickyr nagh bee aggle erbee, agh dy jig reddyn yindysagh vouesyn.","These are who are are expecting to see taking a greater share in Manx (language) things, and I am sure that there will be no fear, but that wonderful things will come from them.",

Ta mee shickyr dy row shoh yn loayrtys share dy row rieeau currit roin syn ellan shoh er lheid yn cooish shoh.,I am sure that this was the best talk that was ever given before us in this island on such a topic as this.,
"Va Eibhlin cho ghoosyssagh, nagh row peiagh erbee ’sy halley gyn moylley er e son. S’treisht lhein ooilley dy vees caa ain dy gheddyn shilley jeeish reesht dy lheah. ",Eibhlin was so natural that there easn’t a person in the hall without praise for her. We all trust that we will have an opportunity to get to see her again soon.,
"Bee coontey ry gheddyn mychione yn chagglym shoh ayns ny paberyn, as gyn ourys bee eh coontey lane dy voylley.","There will be a report available about this gathering in the papers, and no doubt it will be a report full of praise.",
"Er lhiam dy vel yn traa er jeet, son ard Arganys ennagh eddyr ain ooilley, mychione reddyn Ceiltiagh, ny dy jarroo mychione red erbee. ","I think that the time has come, for some great debate between us all, about Celtic things, or indeed, about anything.",

","I am well aware that I am not the first person to say this, and indeed, I am sure the I won’t be the last one, but nevertheless I am saying it again, and it should be being said until there is something done about it.",
"Cha nel eh red dooillee dy yannoo yn lhied, son va’n red hene dy ve jeant, agh cha row pyagh ny jees abyl dy heet. ","It is not a difficult thing to do such a thing, because the same thing was to be done, but one or two people were unable to come.",
"Cha row shen leshtal erbee dooin, son va dy liooar dooinyn ayns shen dy chummal yn lheid.","That is no excuse at all for us, because there were enough of us there to hold such a thing.",
Vel tholtan erbee er y cheer boayl erbee oddagh shin meiteil ayn? ,Is there any tholtan in the countryside that we could meet in?,
"Sheign da ve yn lheid, as eer mannagh row clea urree, cha lhissagh shen booirrey orrin, er son nagh vel ram sleih er gheddyn ass reddyn foddey ny smessey na shen.","There must be such a thing, and even if thre were no roof on it, that shouldn’t worry us, because have not many people gotten out of far worse things than that.",
