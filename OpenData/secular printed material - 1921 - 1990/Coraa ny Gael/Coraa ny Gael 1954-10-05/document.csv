YN QUEEYL LAXA KEEAD BLEIN DY EASH,THE LAXEY WHEEL A HUNDRED YEARS OLD,
"EC chaglym ry-lhiattee y queeyl kion fenish y theay, docklee magh Chalse Mooar y Crayne, banceyr Laxa, y loayrtys shoh, ass chengey ny mayrey Ellan Vannin. ","At a gathering to the side of the wheel, in presence of the public, Big Charles Craine, a Laxey banker, announced this talk, in the mother-tongue of the Isle of Man.",
"     Keead blein er dy-henney son yn laa jiu va chaglym mooar dy leih ayns shoh dy akin Queeyl Mooar Laksaa goaill toshiaght dy hyndaa, as dy akin ben y Chianoort ec y traa shen genmys y wheeyl “Y Yen-seyr Isabella.” ","     A hundred years ago (for) this day there was a arge gathering of people here to see the Great Wheel of Laxey start to turn, and to see the Governor’s wife at that time name the wheel “The Lady Isabella.”",
"     Ta shinyn er nyn jaglym cooidjagh jiu dy aa-vioghey yn laa mooar shen, as dy chooinaghtyn lesh moyrn shen nyn greeaghyn dy row yn wheeyl shoh gientit ayns yn aigney jeh Manninagh Robert Casement, ferdooie jeh’n Ellan shoh, eh-hene ruggit ayns Jurby.","     We are gathered together today to revive that great day, and to remember with that pride of our hearts that this wheel was concieved in the mind of (the) Manxman Robert Casement, a native man of this Island, himself born in Jurby.",
"Choud as ta fys ain, cha row rieau queeyl ny smoo na ee shoh jeant, as nish, son keead blein ta sleih er jeeaghyn lesh yindys urree.","As far as we know, there was never a larger wheel that this made, and now, for a hundred years, people have watched her with wonder.",
Son ny smoo na tree feed blein as jeih v’ee gobbraghey troggal ushtey veih diunid y theill as cur lhee sauchys dauseyn va gobbraghey ayns ny veainyn [sic].,For more than seventy years she worked to raise water from the depth of the world and bring safety to those who were working in the mines.,
"Ayns e bea liauyr, t’ee er chur lhee dys Laksaa tousaneyn ass towse dy leih, ad-hene cur lhieu berchys as sonnys da Laksaa as yn Ellan.","In her long life, she has brought to Laxey innumerable thousands of people, themselves bringing risches and happiness to Laxey and the Island.",
"Ta shin er-y-fa shen, lhiastyn mooarane da’n wheeyl vooar, as da Casement ren troggal ee, as lhisagh shin ec dy chooilley hraa freayll ayns nyn aignaghyn nyn mooise as nyn moyrn son y wheeyl as aynsyn ayns ny enneeyn echey v’ee er ny ghientyn.”","We therefore, owe a great amount to the big wheel, and to Casement who built it, and we ought to, at all times, keep in our minds our thanks and our praise for the wheel and in him in whose brain it was conceived.",
