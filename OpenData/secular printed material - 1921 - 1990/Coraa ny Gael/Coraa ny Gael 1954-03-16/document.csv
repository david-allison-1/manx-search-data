"Ta treisht ain ooilley dy bee turrys mie mirrilagh eck as dy jig ee er-ash dy-sauchey, ooraghit ayns corp as aigney.","We all trust that she will have a miraculously good trip and that she will come back safely, refreshed in body and mind.",

"Rah dy row ort, a charrey veen! Booise da Jee dy vel dty lheid foast ayn!","Prosperity to you, dear friend! Thank God  people like you still exist!",

Manx speaker and Methodist lay preacher."
Ta’n cree vie echeysyn jannoo foays dooin ooilley.,His good heart does us all good.,
S’aittin lhein dy re Manninagh dooie t’ayns yn oik onnoroil shen t’echey hene.,It seems best to us that it is a native Manxman that is in that honourable office that he holds.,
     Ta ny guillyn jeh’n vrastyl Straaid Ridgeway jannoo feer vie ec y Ghailck nish.,     The boys of Ridgeway Street class are doing very well at Manx now.,
"Ta’d er ve mygeayrt er y cheer mayrym keayrt ny ghaa, lesh shilley er ooilley ny shenn sleih, er y Twoaie Vooar as er y Jiass neesht. ","They have been around the country with me many times, to visit all the old people, in the Great North and the South too.",

"Ta’n obbyr aym pene maroo, bunnys cooilleenit, as cha bee eh foddey, derrey bee adsyn gynsaghey shinyn ta ny shinney, dy jarroo, t’ad jannoo shen hannah, ny keayrtyn.","My own work with them is almost fufilled, and it won’t be long until they will be teaching us who are older, indeed, they are doing that already, sometimes.",
"Kied echey[2], te “jannoo foays da my chree dy eishtagh roo,” myr yiarragh nyn garrey veen, Ned Madderell.","Anyway, “listening to them raises my spirits” as our dear old friend Ned Maddrell would say.",[2] Keid echey] evidently used for ‘anyway’ here.

"Keid echey, ta mee son ooilley, as ta ny litiryn echey jannoo foays dooin ooilley.","Anyway, I do after all, and his letters do us all good.",
"Ta [sic] er n’gaase ny s’ashoonagh neayrs t’eh er ve ersooyl ayns eebyrtys, as ga dy vel eh jannoo dy mie aynshen my ta Manninee ooilley ayns cheer quiaagh, ta mee sheiltyn dy vel y chree echey foast ayns Mannin villish veg veen. ","He has become more patriotic since he has been away in exile, and although he is doing well there, as all Manx people do in a  foreign country, I imagine that his heart is still in the dear sweet little Isle of Man.",
"Ta treisht ain dy jig eh dy-valley dy moghey, as eisht bee caa ain dy ghra “Chaist Sonney Dhyt” rish.","We trust he will come home early, and then we will have a chance to say “Happy Easter to You”, to him.",

Ta shoh obbyr feu da’n Thie Hasthee dy yannoo.,This is a job worthy for the Museum to do.,
"Lishagh yn lheid ve jeant ocsyn ayns ynnyd jeh slaa pabyr lesh caslysyn jeh Mannin fo’n Rio Vooar, thousaneyn dy vleeaney er dy henney.","Such things as this ought to done by them instead of daubing paper with images of the Isle of Man under the Great Ice, thousands of years ago.",

"Cha gredjym dy vel yn lheid er ny akin ayns clou foast, as nee yn obbyr Walter cooney lesh “Cooish ny Ghailckey” reesht.","I don’t believe that such has been seen in print yet, and Walter’s work will help “The Cause of Manx” again.",
