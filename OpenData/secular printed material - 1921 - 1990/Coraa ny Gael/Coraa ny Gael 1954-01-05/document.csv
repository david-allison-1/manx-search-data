","     When Bernard Caine and I were coming home from Ramsey to Douglas on the tram the other day we were explaining Manx, speaking in Manx in loud voices.",
"Ghow daa inneen nyn soie faggys dooin yindys mooar tra dooyrt Bernard red ennagh ass Baarle, as blass feer foddey erreish echey!","Two girls sitting near us were very surprised when Bernard said something in English, with a very far-back accent!",
"     Hug yn Breagagh, Kione Jiarg, Walter y Chleree, Bernard y Caine as mish shilley er yn shenn Ghaaue ayns ny Curreeyn Jedoonee, as dy jarroo v’eh ayns slaynt as cree yindyssagh, mie “ass cuestion.”[1] ","     Breagagh, Kione Jiarg, Walter Clarke, Bernard Caine and I visited the old Gaaue (smith) in the curraghs on Sunday, and indeed, he was in wonderful health and spirits, good ‘beyond question’.","[1] ass cuestion] the word [ass] here is not the common Manx word meaning ‘out of’, ‘originating from’, etc., but its homographic homophone [ass] ‘beyond’, as in [ass towse] ‘beyond measure’."
"Hug shin da mess[2] as thombagey, as bannaghtyn ny Bleeaney Noa neesht. ","We gave him fruit and tobacco, and New Year’s greetings too.","[1] mess] ‘a fruit’, [messyn] ‘fruit (plural)’ would be expected here."
"Dooyrt yn dooinney hene nagh row yn Ollick echey ro vie, er y fa nagh row red lajer erbee ayn dy iu: cha nee eshyn ta jannoo mooar jeh tey!","The man himself said that his Christmas wasn’t too good, because there wasn’t anything strong to drink: it isn’t him who’s cherishing tea! ",
"     Tammylt beg er dy henney screeu mee ass nyn Ghaelg rish Aindriai O Muimhneachain, yn fer-ynsee jeh “Eaisht as Ynsee” (ny lessoonyn Yernagh er Radio Eireann Jelune as Jesarn ec lieh oor lurg shiaght). ","       A little while ago I wrote in our Gaelic to Aindriai O Muimhneachain, the teacher of “Listen and Learn” (the Irish lessons on Radio Eireann on Monday and Saturday at half past seven).    ",
"     Hooar mee freggyrt ayns polt screeut ayns Yernish, as ta mish toiggal dagh fockle jeh! ","     I received an answer in a flash written in Irish, and I understand every word of it!",
"Ta mee geaishtagh rish ny lessoonyn shoh, as dy firrinagh t’ad nyn gooney niartal son peiagh ennagh gynsaghey nyn Ghaelg.","I am listening to these lessons, and truly they are a mighty help for someone learning our Gaelic.",
     C’red ta jannoo er ny inneenyn jeh’n Ellan shoh? Vel ad ro volvanagh dy ynsaghey Gaelg? S’goan mraane as Gaelg oc nish—scammyltagh shen! ,     What’s up with the girls of this Island? Are they too stupid to learn Manx? How scarce women who know Manx are now — that’s disgraceful!,
"Cha nel eh goll rish shen sy Thallo-Bretnagh; t’ad feer ghraihagh er y cheer[3] as y ghlare oc ayns shen, myr ren mee fakin ec y Co-hionnal Celtiagh ayns Borth.","It’s not like that in Wales; they are very fond of the country and their language there, as I saw at the Celtic Conference in Borth.",[1] cheer] text gives [cleer]
"     Va ashlish virrilagh ayms riyr; va ooilley ny Manninee dooie er chee dy[4] cheau yn tourey ry cheilley sy Gaeltacht Yernagh. Gyn un ourys, veagh shen flaunyssagh! ","     I had a miraculous vision last night, all the native Manx people were about to spend the summer together in the Irish Gaeltacht. Without a single doubt, that would be heavenly.","[1] er chee dy] — in Classical Manx ‘trying to’, ‘seeking to’ or ‘for the purpose of’. In the 20th C more often used to translate ‘about to’. "
