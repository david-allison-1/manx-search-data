","Both Joyce and Doug were looking well, and they were smiling at us now and again, and when the time came for them to go towards the Airport, I am sure that some of us were feeling a little bit miserable to see them go away, though we ought not have been so stupid.",
"Va shen my smooiniaght, as yn red cheddin ec carrey elley aym, agh hie shen ersooyl bunnys dy jeeragh. ","That was my thought, and the same of another friend of mine, but they went away almost directly.",
