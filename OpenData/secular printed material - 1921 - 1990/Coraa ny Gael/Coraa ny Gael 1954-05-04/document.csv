"Ta shin er chlashtyn voish Tobm Braide reesht, as t’eh er ash ec obbyr jannoo e chooid share dy reayl ny Soystynee gyn paays — adsyn sy Balla Scryssey Niar aght erbee.","We have heard from Tom Braide again, and he is back at work doing his best to keep the English people thirst free — those in Eastbourne anyway.",

"Bee yn fliaghey jeh foays vooar da’n thalloo, as cur er arroo as faiyr gaase.","The rain water will be of great benefit to the land, and make the corn and grass grow.",
