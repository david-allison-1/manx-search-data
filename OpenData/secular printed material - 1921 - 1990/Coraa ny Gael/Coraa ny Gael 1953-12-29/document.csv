CORAA NY GAEL,The Voice of the Gaels,
Gyn-dooyt ta shiu er chlashtyn mychione possan dy Vretnee ta baghey nish ayns Patagonia? ,No doubt you have heard about the group of Welsh people that now live in Patagonia? ,
"Daag nyn shenayryn cheer nyn ghooie, as lhian ad rish y Vretnish, myr shen ta chengey ny mayrey Vretnish foast goll er loayrt mastey cloan ny clienney oc.","Their ancestors left their native country, and they stuck to Welsh, so the native language of Welsh is still being spoken amongst their grandchildren.",
"Nish, vel fys eu dy row lheid y possan dy Vanninee ayns America kiare feed vlein er dy henney as Gailck oc?","Now, do you know that there was a group of Manx people like this in America eighty years ago who knew Manx?",
"Shoh paart jeh’n screeuyn ’sy Ghailck liorish yn Arrymagh J. T. Clarke, scruit echey ’sy vlein 1872, as currit magh ayns “The Manx Quarterly,” No. 20. Vol. IV (1918)","This is some of the letter in Manx by the Reverend J. T. Clarke, written by him in the year 1872, and published in “The Manx Quarterly,” No. 20. Vol. IV (1918)",
Myr shoh t’ou cur-my-ner dy row eer maase y vagheragh ayns ny shenn traaghyn roish nish toiggal y Ghailck ny share na ta’n chooid smoo dy leih nish.,"So, you see that even the cattle of the field in the old days before now understood Manx better than the majority of people now.",
"“Lhig jee goll ro’ee,” jir ad “cre sheeu ee dooin nish? ... lhig j’ee goll ro’ee raad saillee.”","“Let it go,” they will say “what is it worth to us now? ... let it go where it likes.”",
"Agh ta mysh thousane dy Vanninee ayns ayrn jeh America enmyssit Cleveland, nagh n’yiarragh shoh, “lhig j’ee goll ro’ee raad saillee.”","But there are about a thousand Manx people in a part of America called Cleveland, who wouldn’t say this, “Let it go where it likes.”",
"She Gailck t’oc ooilley ec meeiteilyn ry-cheilley ayns nyn ghellal dagh laa, ayns soilshaghey Goo Yee da’n phobbyl as bunnys dy chooilley nhee elley. Ec y traa cheddin nagh vel sleih erbee mygeayrt-y-moo ta Baarle veg share oc.","It is Manx they all have at meetings together, in their daily dealings, in expounding God’s Word to the people, and almost every other thing. At the same time there aren’t any people around about them who have any better English.",

"Va jees jeu keayrt ec my hie’s bleeantyn dy-mie er-dy-henney. Va fer jeu ruggit ayns America, ga jeh ayr as moir Vanninagh. V’eh ynsit son leighder. ","There were two of them once at my house years ago. One of them was born in America, though of a Manx father and mother. He was trained to become a lawyer.",
"Va’n ’er elley mac shayrey dou-hene, hie roish ’syn aegid echey dys America, as tra daag eh yn Ellan cha row eh toiggal veg agh Baarle.","The other one was my own nephew, who went in his youth to America, and when he left the Island he understood nothing but English.",
"Hug ad yindys orrym-pene dy chlashtyn yn Ghailck vie v’oc, as cha row eh jannoo hyntyr erbee da’n Vaarle v’oc. Va daa ghlare oc ayns ynnyd unnane!","They made me wonder to hear their good Manx, and it wasn’t hindering their English at all. They had two languages intead of one!",
