  "notes": "The Manx of \u2018Coraa ny Gael\u2019 differs in some respects to Classical Manx. In common with Late Manx an extra article is sometimes added superfluously to genitive constructions and mutation can be somewhat haphazard. Other features not usually found in Late Manx are occassional unexpected choices of prepositions, unexpecred usage of \u2018independent\u2019 and \u2018dependent\u2019 forms, and the strenuous avoidance of loanwords. The orthography usually agrees with Classical Manx. The introduction of new words and idioms are few, with notable examples being [dy chooilley co-hiaghtin] for \u2018every other week\u2019, rather than [dagh kegeeish] \u2018every fortnight\u2019, and other uses of the prefix [co-], such as [co-hionnal] and [co-haglym] \u2014 both being used for \u2018conference\u2019 and \u2018congress\u2019.",
