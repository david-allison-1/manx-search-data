PINGYN YN OMMIDAN,The Fool’s Pennies.,
"Ayns balley-mergee dy row, va fer-cheirdey enmysit Thom —, as v’eh ayr da queig dy chloan. Cha row eh er ny ve ass obbyr rish kiare bleeaney jeig my baillish gobbragh.

He wouldn’t have been out of work for fourteen years if he had been prepared to work. But he learnt the bad habit of going to the pub with several blockheads, almost every day. In the morning on his way to his work, he couldn’t get past without going in for a drop, as he himself said, “to put the wind out of his mouth”[1] and going past on his way home at night without going in to have a bit of a chat over a pint or two, was a thing he couldn’t think about doing.","[1] dy choyrt yn gheay ass e veeal—Perhaps an idiom equivalent to ‘to put the wind in his sails’, or ‘to freshen up’?"
"     Ny-cheayrtyn, as cha nee feer anvenick noadyr, ragh eh roish gys y thie-oast, as hoieagh eh sheese giu gys foddey lurg traa-lhie. Lheid y greim lajer ghow’n cleayn shoh er, derry heill y dooinney boght dy row eh red va nauyn da, as nagh voghe eh dy bragh rey rish.","     Sometimes, and not very seldom either, he would go to the pub, and he would sit down drinking until long after bedtime. Such a strong grip upon him this inclination took, until the poor man would supposed that it was something that was a necessity for him, and that he would never get rid of it.",
"     V’eh fakin e ven-heshey coamrit ayns frytlaggyn, as va’n chenjallys boallagh ve eddyr oc ceaghlut gys troiddey, streeu, oltooan, as bwoalley. Va’n chloan myrgeddin goll mow laccal bee as eaddagh. Cha row fort echey faill ’choyrt da’n vainshtyr-schoillar son y nynsagh oc, as cha row fys echey ayns e cheeayl cre’d dy yannoo.","     He was seeing his wife dressed in rags, and the kindness that used to be between them changed to rowing, strife, insult, and thumping. The children were also perishing for lack of food and clothing. He didn't have the means to give pay to the school-master for their education, and he didn’t know in his mind[2] what to do ",[2] as cha row fys echey ayns e cheeayl—Perhaps an idiom equivalent to ‘at his wit’s end’?
"     Dy-ve-shickyr v’eh geddyn faill vie cour y chiaghtin, agh c’raad va’n argid ooilley goll cha bione da. Er-lesh nagh blhiass da’n ven ve jannoo wheesh dy feiyr,—cha row’n bine v’eh goaill ’sy voghrey red mooar, ny ec y vunlaa, as cha nee lane glen v’eh goaill toshiaght ny hoie—my haghyragh da laa ny jees dy iu ’ghoaill nish as reesht, er-lesh nagh beeu j’ee taggloo jeh, son, my beeir da hene, va lheid y red ymmyrchagh son dy niartaghey as dy chummal seose e challin, lurg garrey trome dy obbyr chreoie; as v’eh goaill er dy ghra, nagh row ny v’eh giu, red erbee as y raad da dooinney va tooilleil cha doccaragh as veshyn.","     To be sure, he was getting good weekly pay, but where all the money was going he knew not. He thought the missus didn’t need to make so much din,— the drop he was taking in the morning wasn’t a big thing, nor at midday, and he wasn’t starting the night completely unaffected—if he happened to have a day or two of drinking, he thought it wouldn’t be worth talking of, because if what he said to himslef was true, such a thing was necessary for to strenghthen and to support his body, after a heavy spell of hard work;  and he was presuming to say, that what he was drinking wasn’t anythng untoward for a man who was toiling as hard as he was.",
"     V’eh goaill rish dy row eh, paart dy cheayrtyn, cur roie beg gys y thie-oast Jedoonee dy geddyn bine, as cre’n assee mooar oddagh ve ayns jannoo shen, fakin dy row leigh as cliaghtey ny cheerey lowal jeh, as sleih elley va foddey share na ve hene jannoo, er-nonney begin da hreigeil y cheshaght oc.

He was putting all his poverty and his distress down to bad planning in some way or other, but it wasn’t clear to him how he could be guilty himself, and he was taking it very badly that the missus was so constantly threatening and blaming him.",
"     Agh myr v’eh ny hoie ayns y thie-oast er moghrey Doonaght dy row lurg da ny iuderyn elley v’er n’gholl magh, haghyr dy daink ny fir-oik mygeayrt, as son dy cheiltyn eh voue, as dy haghney smaght y leigh, deie yn ven-oast,—“Houe!

Bannaght ort! jean siyr.”","      But as he was sat in the pub on one Sunday morning after the other drinkers had gone out, it so happened that the officers came around, and to conceal him from them, and to avoid the discipline of the law, the landlady called—“Hey! Tom love, the policemen are coming! and if they catch you in here, or if they see you going out, it’s as sure as needs be we’ll both be fined; for there are four holy hours on a Sunday, in which it won’t do for me to sell stuff, otherwise, if they find out about it, I’ll lose the license and I’ll be ruined forever. Come on up the stairs with me, and I’ll give you a sight of the spendid things in the loft, whilst they’ll be looking down here. Bless you! Hurry up!”",
"      Shoh raait, hie eh geiyrt urree veih boayl dy boayl, as goaill lane yoindys jeh’n stoo-thie ooasle, as ny fillosheryn mooarey v’eh fakin, dooyrt eh rish hene, “Sheain-y-mie orryms![3] ta’n thie shoh goll-rish Plaase.” As ve mirril da kys oddagh lheid ny reddyn ’ve.","     This said, he followed her from place to place, and was completely amazed by the posh furniture, and great ornaments he was seeing, he said to himself, “Oh my God! this house is like a palace!” And it was a miracle to him how such things could be.","[3] sheain eh mie orrin—in. an interjection of wonder or surprise, praying that God might diffuse his good peace on or among us. (Cregeen)."
"     Choud as v’eh myr shoh dowin smooinaghtyn, as dy trimshagh blakey, ren eh cosoylagh ’yannoo, ayns e aigney, eddyr yn verchys v’eh fakin mygeayrt y mysh, as yn voghtynid, yn treihys, as y trustyr v’ayns e hie hene.","     Whilst he was thinking deeply like this, and staring sadly, he made a comparison in his mind, between the riches he was seeing around about him, and the poverty, the misery, and the rubbish that was in his own house. ",
"     Lurg shen, hug ee lh’ee stiagh eh ayns ynnyd va enmysit yn Drawing-room—as mannagh ghow Thom yindys roie ghow yindys eisht. Cha row fys echey ayns e cheeayl c’red dy ghra.

He didn’t have a clue what to say. When he saw the incredibly splendid covering that was on the floor he was afraid—he didn’t dare put as much as his foot on it—indeed, she told him to clean his feet if he were to go in. However, he was far, far more amazed when he saw the beautiful mirror, that was so big that it reached almost from the floor up to the ceiling. In it he saw the full image of his own body, covered in old worn-out clothing, filthy, and ragged, although he had no more change of cloth. ",
"     Agh v’eh ec kione e cheilley ooilley-cooidjagh tra doshil y ven-oast coolley v’er red myr towl ’sy voayl, raad va skellooyn soit magh lesh red earrooagh dy hiyn sollys, soilshean myr whilleen rollage.

Cre’n aght ayns y theihll hooar shiu ooilley ny reddyn mirrilagh shoh? “Cammah Yuilley,” as ish, gearey as cassey ’gob er, “LESH PINGYN YN OMMIDAN SHICKYR.”","     However, he was at the end of his wits altogether when the landlady opened a door that was over something like a hole in the wall, where there were shelves set out with a numerous amount of bright vessels, shining like so many stars. He opened his mouth and his eyes, he raised up his hands, and he called out “Save and bless me! Great woman! How in the world did you get all these miraculous things?” ",
,"     “Come on boy,” she said, smiling and twisting her mouth, “SURE, WITH THE FOOL’S PENNIES.”  ",
"     Agh hie ny goan cheddin, pingyn yn ommidan, myr syde gys cree Hom, as dooyrt eh rish hene, “Ommidan! ommidan dy-liooar ta mish er ve son fer.” Eisht hie eh roish lesh ny focklyn eck dy dowin gruntit ayns e chooinsheanse.

Quite a fool of a man I’ve been.” Then he went off with her words grounded deep in his conscience. And as he was taking the road, sadly scratching his head and talking to himself, he made a steadfast promise, in his mind, that he wouldn’t come into the last house he had left, or into any other house of the sort, for a full year—but, if he were alive, and all well at that time, that he would put a visit in again.",
"     Tra rosh eh thie, ghow’n ven as ny paitchyn lane yindys dy row eh er jeet cha leah, son she feer anvennick v’eh cliaghtey heet roish traa-lhie. As tra va’n astyr er n’gholl er dy mie, ghow eh yn Vible neose jeh’n lat, raad v’ee er ny ve faagit ry foddey dy hraa coodit lesh joan, myr red neufeeu, as lhaih eh cabdil ny jees daue ass j’ee my jagh ad gys fea.","     When he reached home, the missus and the children were amazed that he had come so soon, because it was very unusual that he used to come before bedtime. And when the evening had progressed well, he took the Bible down off the shelf, where it had been left for a long time, covered in dust, like a useless object, and he read a chapter or two to them from it before they went to rest.",
"     Moghrey yn laa er-giyn, haghyr dy row shiartanse dy skilleeyn echey nagh row baarit, as hug eh ad da unnane jeh ny inneenyn, gra r’ee “Nish, immee royd dy bieau as kionnee stuggey dy willeen, kuse dy hea, shuggyr, eeym, as caashey—jean siyr thie lhiannoo mie.” Ren shoh ard voggey da’n slane lught-thie.

Indeed, the missus was lost in wonder. He took a hold of her hand, and he said to her, “Old Lady, I guess that you’re surprised at me, and it’s no wonder I think for you, but I’ll tell you what, I learned a lesson yesterday that I won’t be able to soon forget. I’ve made up my mind that the gready landlady won’t have me on a lead any longer; and when you find me throwing money away on the stuff again—even one penny—you can say what you like to me.”  This was the the happiest day that was ever spent together by the said family; indeed, the wife said that she wasn’t any happier on her wedding day.",
"      Fy-yerrey, haink kione ny bleeaney er dyn traa daag Thom jeh goll gys y thie-oast.

It was a bright summer Sunday morning, and he said to his wife and the children for them to put on their best clothing in time to take a walk with him at eight o’clock; and as they loved to be obedient to him, they weren’t slack in doing as he hurried them to do. Then he took a hold of his wife’s arm, and led each one of them, one of the younger children on his hand, and the older ones went skipping merrily ahead of them.",
"     Myr shoh jimmee ad derrey haink ad gys y thie-oast ayn boallagh Thom ve ceau wheesh jeh eh hraa sluggey, as shassoo cheu-mooie jeeragh er y dorrys, dooyrt eh rish e ven, “Nish Vuddee, shegin dhyts as ny paitchyn gholl stiagh maryms ayns shoh son thootchey beg, as hee-ys shiu red ennagh vees taitnyssagh diu.”","     They went like this until they came to the pub in which Tom used to be speanding so much of his time gulping, and standing right outside of the door, he said to his wife, “Now, Lass, you and the children must come in here with me for a little while, and you’ll see something that you’ll enjoy.”",
"     Tra cheayll y ven eh er ghra shoh, v’ee ooilley er-creaue, goaill aggle dy row yn dooinney eck goll dy huittym dys giu ass-y-noa.

Nevertheless, they went in, and there Tom found his old comrades just as they used to be when he himself was partaking of the booze with them before now—beardy, ragged, and stinking, as if there wasn’t a drop of water in the country. When they saw Tom, with his wife and the children having come, they jumped up, and they shouted, “Ha! Thomas, what wind has blown you to here?” For though Black Tom is what they’d call him before, they were calling him Thomas now.",[4] v’ee ooilley er-creaue—Perhaps an idiom equivalent to ‘a shiver went down her spine’?
"     Tra hug y ven-oast myner dooinney as ben doaieagh, marish queig pohnnaryn stuitt as dy mie coamrit er jeet stiagh, ghow ee lane glen yindys; son va caghlaa cronnal ayndoo voish ny drollaneyn boght leih-veshtal va kionenish. “Cammah, Ven-y-thie,” dooyrt Thom, “vel shiu cur enn orrym?” “Cammah,” dreggyr ish, dy brynnagh, “s’coan my ta, foast, er-lhiam dy vel mee er n’akin shiu roie.”—“Hem’s raane dy vel shen, as keayrt ny ghaa neesht, Ven-y-thie,” dooyrt eshyn, “mish Thom, ’nane jeh ny shenn ainjyssee eu.” “Graih Vannaght!” as ish, “nod eh ve?

And so it is too. What’s this great change that’s come upon you? I’ll make the assurance that you are a fine gentleman now. Is this the wife,—are these your children? Come on down into the parlour—will you have anything to drink? How sturdy you all are. How in the world has this happened?”—“O, Landlady,” answered Tom, “there’s nothing easier, the fool’s pennies I used to be giving to you to clothe yourself and your big house, I now keep for our own use.”",[5] bryd—bred—‘fine’ (Kelly)
