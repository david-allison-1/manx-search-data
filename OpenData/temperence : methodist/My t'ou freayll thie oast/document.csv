"My t’ou freayll thie-oast, as cur y scooyr da sleih: GOW TASTEY.","If you keep a public house, and give booze to people: TAKE NOTE.",
"PHECCAGH BOGHT,",POOR SINNER,
"     T’ou ayns stayd feer treih dy-jarroo! S’mie ta fys ayd hene er, dy vel uss as dty lught-thie moyrnagh beaghey dy roauyr, liorish jannoo assee da ymmodee feallagh elley.","     You are in a really wretched state indeed! Well you know it yourself, that you and your proud family are living repletely, by doing harm to many others.",
"     T’ou unnane jeh ny sharvaantyn s’daaney as s’firrinee t’ec Noid-ny-hanmey er slane eaghtyr y thallooin; son t’ou jannoo meshtallee, maarlee maarderee, as dunveryn jeh dty heshaghtyn cretoor, as geiyrt ad gys tort-mow. T’ou er lheiggal, as er lhottey ymmodee deiney lajer; as shimmey’n fer trean t’er ny ve stroit liort. Ta dty hie yn raade gys niurin, goll sheese gys shamyryn y vaaish; as cha vel y leigh shen ta lhiggey ny reddyn shoh lhiat monney share na oo hene.","     You are one of the boldest and truest servants the Devil (lit; ‘Enemy-of-the-soul’) has on the whole surface of the earth; for you are drunkards, thieves, philanderers and muurderers of your fellow creatures, and driving them to destruction. You have felled, and wounded, many strong men; and many’s the heroic man that has been laid waste by you. Your house is the road to hell, going doin to the chambers of death; and that law that lets you alone with these things isn’t much better than you yourself are. ",
"     She foddey roud t’ou uss as dty horch er ve freilt lhieeney shiu hene lesh yn eill-vart share, as ceau coamraghyn souyr as berchagh, choud as nagh row scoan craue ec lught-thie yn iuder dy spulgey, ny chooid er-doaie dy chur moo, by-chyndagh riu.","     For far too long you and your sort have been kept, filling yourselves with the best beef, and wearing comfortable and wealthy clothes, whilst the family of the drinker had hardly a bone to peck at, or decent things to put on, because of you.",
"     Vel chymmey erbee ayns dty chree? Vel nearey ayns dty eddin? T’ou freayll yn eaddagh jeh dreem mraane as paitchyn ny iuderyn, as yn bee ass nyn meeal. Shimmey keayrt t’ou er chur dy lhie ad lesh bolg follym as cree ching; as cha nee red beg ayns earroo jeu, t’ou er choyrt lesh seaghyn gys yn oie, roish nyn draa.","     Is there any compassion in your heart? Is there shame in your face? You keep the clothing off the backs of women and children of the drinkers, and food out of their mouths: Many’s the time you have put them to bed with an empty stomach and a sick heart; and it isn’t a small number of them that you have sent with sorrow to the grave, before their time. ",
"     Gow nearey jeed hene Lah! Gleashee dty chorp mooar litcheragh, as jeeagh mygeayrt y mood son obbyr onneragh ennagh dy yannoo; er-nonney bee oo gauagh dy liooar dy ve, ayns traa giare, myr Buggane-ushag—ec y sleih dy ghearey ort, as dy yannoo gamman jeed. ","     Be ashamed of yourself Lad! Move your big lazy body and look around about you for some honourable work to do; otherwise you will be in quite some danger of being, in a short while, like a scarecrow—for the people have to laugh at, and to make fun of (you).",
"     Nagh nhimmey dooinney as ben dreill thieyn oast, as va keayrt dy row chiart cha mooaralagh as t’ou uss nish, ta shin er nakin shooyl-ny-dhieyn as y poagey oc?","     Aren’t there many a man and woman who kept pubs, and were once upon a time just as full of themselves as you are now, that we have seen begging from house to house with their bag?",
"     Cre ta’n Vible Casherick gra mychione dty lheid-ys? Jeeagh ayns y trass chabdil yeig-as-feed jeh Lioar y Phadeyr Isaiah, as yiow fys er:—Smerg dhyt’s ta spooilley, as nagh r’ou hene spooillit; as ta dellal dy molteyragh, as nagh ghell as dy molteyragh rhyt’s! tra nee oo scuirr veih spooilley, bee oo hene er dty spooilley; as tra scuirr-ys oo veih dellal dy molteyragh, dellee adsyn dy molteyragh rhyt’s. ","     What does the Holy Bible say about your sort? Look in the thirty-third chapter of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah, and you will find information about it:— Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal",
,treacherously with thee.,
"     My nee oo agh lhaih yn nah chabdil jeh Phadeyrys Habakuk, hee-ys oo dy vel mollaght y Chiarn croghey er-skyn dty chione.","     If you only read the second chapter of the Prophet Habakuk, you will see that the Curse of the Lord hangs above your head.",
"     Eisht, er graih dty annym hene, chammah as son foays dty heshaghtyn cretoor, gow coyrle; as ayns ynnyd ve ard-vollaght da’n seihll, gow arrys, faag jeh dty ghrogh-yannoo, as guee gys Jee son pardoon. Lhiasee dty vea choud as ta caa ayd, as foddee ooilley ve dy mie mayrt foast. ","     Then, for the sake of your own soul, as well as for the benefit of your fellow creatures, take advice, and instead of being a great curse to the world, repent, quit your bad act, and pray to God for pardon. Improve your life whilst you have a chance, and all may be good with you yet.",
"     Eishtagh, bee oo bannaght dhyt hene as da sleih elley; cha bee sleih crauee veg sodjey jeeaghyn quaagh ort, myr ta’d nish, agh jarrood ny ta shaghey, bee ad gennal rhyt , as gowee ad lane glen boggey jeed, son dy vel oo er hyndaa; as er jeet dy ve sheshey cooie da sleih doaieagh.","     Then, you will be a blessing to yourself and to other people; religious people will no longer be looking strangely at you, as they do now, but will forget that which is past, they will be genial towards you, and they will take pure joy in you, because you have changed; and become a suitable partner for decent people.",
