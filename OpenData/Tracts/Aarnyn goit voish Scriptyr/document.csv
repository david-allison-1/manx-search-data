"Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip; for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received its just recompense of reward; how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will!

Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?

Whither shall I go then from thy Spirit: or whither shall I go then from thy presence? If I climb up into heaven, thou art there: if I go down to hell, thou art there also. If I take the wings of the morning: and remain in the uttermost parts of the sea; Even there also shall thy hand lead me: and thy right hand shall hold me. If I say, Peradventure the darkness shall cover me: then shall my night be turned to day.

(Ps. cxxxix. 1–12.)[1]","[1] In fact, vv. 1-11. The Manx Bible text of the Psalms translates not the text of the AV (1611) which is in Scripture Extracts, but that of the Prayer Book, which I have substituted here. The text in Scripture Extracts (=AV) is ‘O Lord, thou hast searched me and known me; thou Knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising: thou understandest my thoughts afar off: thou compassest my path, and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord! thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit; or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there: If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there thy hand shall lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me: If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me: yea, the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.’"

"Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? For thou only art holy; for all nations shall come and worship before thee: for thy judgments are made manifest.

"The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and fourth generation. (Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7.)",,"Yn Chiarn, Yn Chiarn Jee, myghinagh as graysoil, jeh surranse-foddey, as feoiltagh ayns mieys as ayns ynrickys, freaylley myghin gour thousaneyn, mial[4] meechraueeaght, as loghtyn, as peccah, as nagh jean, er saase erbee, ny kimmee y heyrey: kerraghey peccaghyn ny ayraghyn er y chloan, as er cloan ny chlienney, gys y trass as y chiarroo heeloghe.

The standard spelling maih may be intended to represent compensatory lengthening /mɛːi/ from loss of following schwa, cf. raaue ‘warning’ /rɛːu/ from G. rabhadh /ravəɣ/. However, it is possible that the difference in spelling between mie ‘good’ and maih ‘forgive’ was intended simply to differentiate the senses and that both represent /mai/.’"
"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he hath loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, for by grace are ye saved.

"Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom and might are his.

And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit? If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest? Consider the lilies how they grow; they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these. If then God so clothe the grass, which is to-day in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?

Be kindly-affectioned one to another with brotherly love: in honour preferring one another; not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in prayer, distributing to the necessity of the saints, given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute you; bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep. Be of the same mind one towards another; mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceit. Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord; therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. (Rom. xii. 9–21.)",,"Lhig da graih ve fegooish foalsaght; cur-jee dwoaie da shen ta olk; lhian-jee gys shen ta mie.
