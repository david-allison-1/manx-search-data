"[eds: This loving and faithful Monitor has been translated into six languages and now it is intended to translate it into six more languages. Three hundred thousands of them have already been sent out throughout the world, and pious people of every kind—high and low, poor and rich, ministers of the Gospel as well as others—have striven to disseminate it more and more; because a special measure of good has followed it under the blessing of God on so humble a means to waken careless and thoughtless people to an awareness of their sinful state. Drunkards have become sober, the profane pure, and unbelievers have gained a lively faith through this little book which is suitable for the state of every kind of people, and which is by the blessing of God every day more desired.",,"Ta’n Fer-raauee graihagh as firrinagh shoh er ve chyndaait gys shey glaraghyn as t’eh nish smooinit er dy hyndaa eh gys shey glaraghyn elley.

"THIS implies an assurance, that no degree of previous guilt, no inveterate habits of vice, no slavery to Satan, no secret decree of God, no involuntary mistake, no feebleness in coming to Christ, would induce him to reject a single person, who applied lo him for the salvation of his soul, with a sincere desire to obtain that blessing, depending on his truth, power, and grace, and using the means which he hath appointed. In this, the Father’s will, which the Son came down from Heaven to perform, perfectly concurs; it is his will that not one of those given to his Son should be rejected or lost, in life or death; but that every one of them should be raised up lo eternal felicity at the last day.",,"LIORISH shoh ta shickyrys er ny chur dooin nagh bee errey erbee dy loght cre-erbee cha trome as oddys eh y ve, ny cliaghtey peccoil erbee cre-theihll choud te er lhiantyn hooin, ny bondiaght erbee jeh Noid-ny-hanmey ta shin er ve fo, ny kiarail follit erbee jeh’n Ooilley-Niartal, ny marranys erbee bentyn dooin hene, ny annooinid erbee ayns cheet gys Chreest, oyr dasyn dy yiooldey veih unnane erbee ta jannoo accan huggey son saualtys e annym, lesh yeearree firrinagh dy gheddyn yn bannaght shen, coyrt barrant er e irriney, e phooar, as e ghrayse, as jannoo ymmyd jeh ny saaseyn t’eh hene er n’oardrail.

"It comes to the penitent transgressor as a ministration of righteousness,—as a word of reconciliation and peace. It opens the prison doors, and bids the captive go free. The power of the law was great, but in comparison with the gospel, the law was weak, and could make nothing perfect. The power of the law, was for destruction. The power of the gospel, is a life-giving power. The law could only hold down the man who was down before;—it could never give him life again. But the power to give life, is far greater than the power to kill. The gospel is thus mighty to pass by transgressions and sins, to set at liberty the souls that are bound, and to give boldness in the presence of the King of Saints to the poor captives of Satan. When the sinner’s heart is brought under the influence of the gospel, by the power of the Holy Spirit, it takes away the burden of guilt; it silences every accuser; it fills the believer with the confidence of hope; it forbids every weapon to prosper which is formed against him; and condemns every tongue which rises up in judgment against his soul. The justification which the gospel gives, is perfect and entire. The sins of a whole life, however accumulated, however aggravated, are blotted out in one moment, and that for ever. (Luke 7, 47.) Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God who justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ who died;—yea, rather that is risen again;—who is at the right hand of God for ever; and where Christ is, there must his followers be also.

Manasseh[11] was a great sinner,—a murderers; (2 Kings xxi. 16) but he repented, and was pardoned. Thousands of drunkards, swearers, and unbelievers have been pardoned, (on repentance) and received into the kingdom of God. Look up, then, poor trembling sinner; repent, and believe the willingness of God to receive you also into favour, and you will not be cast out. Nothing but unbelief can cause your ruin.

"THIS is a free invitation to every weary and heavy-laden sinner, made by him who alone is able to take away the load of guilt and sin; every person under the pressure of sin, not only may, but must come to Jesus, thus laden with guilt, if he hope to succeed for pardon. While we endeavour to prepare our way by holy qualifications, we rather fill it with stumbling-blocks, whereby our souls are hindered from attaining to the salvation of Christ. Christ would have us to believe on Him, who justifies the ungodly, and therefore he doth not require us to be godly before we believe; he came as a physician for the sick, and doth not expect they should recover their health in the least degree before they come to him. The vilest sinners are fitly prepared and qualified for this merciful[16] design, which is to shew forth the exceeding riches of his grace, pardoning our sins, and saving us freely, Eph. ii. 5–9. It is no affront to Christ, or slighting or contemning the justice and holiness of God, to come to him while we are polluted sinners; but rather it is an affronting and contemning the saving grace, merit, and fulness of Jesus, if we endeavour to make ourselves righteous and holy before we receive Christ himself, and all holiness and righteousness in him by grace.",,"TA shoh cuirrey nastee da dy chooilley pheccagh ta deinagh as trome laadit, currit liorishyn ta ynrycan pooaral dy ghoaill ersooyl yn errey dy loght as dy pheccah; foddys dy chooilley phersoon ta trome laadit lesh peccah cheet, as cha nee ynrycan foddys eh cheet, agh shegin da cheet gys Yeesey, myr shoh trome laadit lesh loght, my t’eh jerkal dy ve er ny phardooney.

"CHRIST’S healing all bodily sickness, was a token of his power and grace, to heal all spiritual diseases of our souls, though ever so desperate and dangerous. Therefore, give thyself wholly up to his care; he understands thy distemper also, and will certainly restore thee. He has healed a great many already; nay, all those whoever desired it, of all their infirmities. Thou canst never be too miserable and bad for him; he is ever willing and able to help. The worse thy case is, the more he will pity thee and have patience. Before we can be made whole, his way is to make us thoroughly sensible of our sickness, and lay our wounds more and more open. But as the physician then is most wanted, we must be the more earnest to implore his help, and he will surely bind us up again and heal us; not at once, but by degrees; often slowly and wonderfully, yet thoroughly at last; for he heals All;— even the most incurable diseases.",,"AYNS dy ren Creest slaanaghey dy chooilley hingys callinagh, ve cowrey jeh e phooar as e ghrayse, dy lheihys ooilley doghanyn spyrrydoil nyn anmeenyn, cre-theihll cha olk as cha dangeyragh as oddys ad y ve.

"In warning you, my fellow-sinner, to flee from the wrath to come, I would address you in words the most tender, and most persuasive, that heart could feel or tongue express, and not with threatenings of curses and punishment;—but in exhorting you, I would call into action the very thunder of language, if possible, to urge you to seek HIM who shed his precious blood, that you might be made an heir of endless life. I would endeavour to point out to you the immensity of His LOVE,—such as never shone on earth before; love the most amazing, such as none but the ever-blessed Son of God could possibly feel for a lost and rebellious world;—and yet to this very world a message was sent from heaven,—even from God himself (by his beloved Son) that it was not his will that any should perish (John vi. 38, 40.)",,"AYNS cur raaue dhyts, my heshey-peccagh, dy hea veih yn jymmoose ta ry-heet, yinnin loayrt rhyt ayns ny goan s’graihagh as s’breeoil, as cha nee liorish baggyrt mollaghtyn as kerraghey;—agh ayns coyrlaghey oo, yinnin geam gys my chooney eer glare dy haarnagh, dy beagh eh possible, dy hionney oo dy hirrey Eshyn ren deayrtey e uill gheyr, dy voddagh uss ve jeant eirey jeh bea dy bragh farraghtyn.

"HOW sweet are the words “ By grace (without merit) ye are saved!”  Here is an overflowing fountain of comfort and divine strength! But how little are the generality of vain and worldly people, who still feed upon husks, acquainted with these words! How little are they relished by our self-righteous moral Christians! but, O! how deliciously does a poor hungering sinner fare upon them! there is hardly any thing less known and understood, as to the power and experience, than the mystery of Christ’s suffering and dying for us, and justification by faith in him; though it is the only paradise and element of believers, and the greatest jewel restored by the Reformation. Such talking and representations of sin as only strike the imagination are not sufficient; but we must also feel the mortal wounds of sin, by which the flesh is mortified, and be actually healed by the stripes of Christ. There is no other way,—for Christ himself has declared that HE is the Way,—the Truth,—and the Life. (John 14, 6.) That no man cometh to the Father but by him. That HE giveth his life for the sheep, (John 10, 11), even eternal life; declaring (John 10. 28, 29) that they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of his hand nor out of his Father’s hand.

What made him trample upon his former legal righteousness, and desire to be found in the righteousness of Christ? Grace, enlightening grace. Wherein consists the difference between the mere moralist and the real christian? There may be a moral conduct where there is no grace, no principle of saving divine faith; there may be the fear of the Lord, taught by the precept of men, and not by the Spirit of God. One may attend the ordinances of religion; have a regard to outward decency; may have a name to live while dead; be high in profession, and at the same time a stranger to the power of godliness; many things outwardly decent and praiseworthy may be done without a principle of grace in the heart: witness Paul before his conversion.",,"CRE ren yn lhiettrimys yindyssagh eddyr Saul yn Pharisee as Paul yn Creestee?

"IT must not be supposed that all nominal Christians are here intended. They who make a credible profession of the gospel, and act in such a manner as to give real Christians a favourable opinion of them, and so gain admittance into their society, are exclusively meant. Of the ten virgins mentioned by our Lord, five were wise, and five were foolish. The foolish had lamps, but no oil in their vessels with which to replenish them: that is, they had just as much religion as was necessary in order to make a plausible appearance; but their hearts were not truly sanctified, and stored with holy affections, by the new-creating Spirit of God. But the wise virgins, when they came to trim their lamps, had oil ready with which to replenish them; thus true Christians, notwithstanding comparative inattention, are habitually ready for all events. With what seriousness, diligence, and fervent prayer, should we then examine ourselves, whether we be in the faith. How afraid of being deceived, where so much is at stake, and coming short of eternal life. How earnestly should we seek for eternal wisdom, and desire to be found upright in the .sight of God, rather than to be approved of by an ill-judging fallen sinner. How dreadful will be the case of those who do not seek the things which accompany salvation till the time is past;—who do not knock till the door is finally closed! Let us, then, my fellow-sinners, make no delay, but he earnest in our preparation for the feast; and let us ever be on our watch, for we know not either the day or the hour, when our Lord cometh.",,"CHA vel eh dy ve smooinit dy vel ooilley adsyn ta enmyssit, creesteenyn, goit stiagh ayns shoh.

In Christ, are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; in him we have present, and eternal good; for he is all, and in all, to the believer. O, Reader, whatever else thou lackest, be careful thou art a possessor of this one thing needful; thy eternal all depends upon it; if thou art sensible of thy need of this blessing, and hast a fervent desire to enjoy it, go to Jesus; he invites such to come to him; and he will freely give himself unto thee, without money, and without price; for he has been pleased graciously to promise, “ HIM THAT COMETH I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT.” ",,"SHOH goan arrymagh nyn Saualtagh bannit loayrit rish Martha, as dy faggys t’eh bentyn rish dy chooilley annym, dy chur tastey da, cre er-bee wheesh as t’ec dooiney er-bee jeh cooid y theill shoh, as ga beagh echey ooilley cooid y theill, as ny-yeih my t’eh fegooish yn un red shoh, t’eh goll rish agglish Laodicea, treih, as seaghnit, as boght, as doal as rooisht.
