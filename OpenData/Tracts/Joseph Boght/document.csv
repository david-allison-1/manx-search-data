POOR JOSEPH.,JOSEPH BOGHT.,1,,
"“Take it, and divide it among the poor friends of the Lord Jesus.”",,1,,
Joseph,"[Engraving of Joseph on his death-bed, with his hand in Dr. Calamy’s.]",1,,
"A poor half-witted man named Joseph, whose employment was to go on errands, and carry parcels, passing through London streets one day, heard psalms singing in a place of worship: he went into it, having a large parcel of yarn hanging over his shoulders; it was Dr. Calamy's meeting-house, St. Mary's, Aldermanbury. A very well-dressed audience surrounded the Doctor. He read the text from 1 Tim. i. 15.—”This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.” From this he preached, in the clearest and simplest manner, the ancient and apostolic gospel, the contents of this faithful saying, viz. That there is eternal salvation for the vilest sinners, solely through the worthiness of Jesus Christ, the God that made all things. “Not many rich, not many noble,” are called by this doctrine, (saith the Apostle;) but “God hath chosen the weak things of this world to confound the things that are mighty.”","Myr va dooinney boght lieh-cheayllagh, enmyssit Joseph, yn obbyr echey v’eh dy gholl er chaghteraghtyn as dy chur lesh erraghyn beggey, shooyl trooid straidyn Lunnin laa dy row, cheayll eh sleih goaill arraneyn-moyllee ayns thie Yee: hie eh stiagh ayn, lesh laad dy naie harrish e gheaylin; va’n cabbal shen cabbal Voirrey, Aldermanbury, as va Saggyrt Calamy vn Shirveishagh.

"Whilst the elegant part of the congregation listlessly heard this doctrine, and if they were struck with any thing at all, it was only with some brilliant expression, or well turned period that dropped from the doctor; —Joseph, in rags, gazing with astonishment, never took his eyes from the preacher, but drank in with eagerness all he said; and trudging homeward, he was heard thus muttering to himself; “Joseph never heard this before; Jesus Christ, the God who made all things, came into the world to save sinners like Joseph; and this is true: and it is a faithful saying.'' —Not long after this, Joseph was seized with a fever, and was dangerously ill. As he tossed upon his bed, his constant language was, “Joseph is the chief of sinners; but Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, and Joseph loves him for this.” His neighbours who came to see him, wondered, on hearing him always dwell on this, and only this: some of the religious sort addressed him in the following manner:— “But what say you of your heart, Joseph? Is there no token for good about it? No saving change there? Have you closed with Christ, by acting faith upon him?” “Ah! no, (says he) Joseph can act nothing—Joseph has nothing to say for himself, but just that he is the chief of sinners; yet seeing that it is a faithful saying, that Jesus, he who made all things, came into the world to save sinners, why may not Joseph after all, be saved?”","Choud’s foddee va paart jeh’n vooinjer verchagh clashtyn yn ynsagh shoh lesh lhag-kiarail, va Joseph ayns frytlaggyn, jeeaghyn er yn Shirveishagh dy gyere lesh yindys; cha ghow eh e hooillyn voish, agh ghow eh stiagh lesh jeeanid ooilley ny loayr eh; as myr v’eh goll thie v’eh er ny chlashtyn loayrt myr shoh rish hene, “Cha geayll Joseph shoh rieau roïe; haink Yeesey Creest, yn Jee chroo dy chooilley nhee, gys y theihll dy hauail peccee goll-rish Joseph; as ta shoh raa firrinagh.” Cha row eh foddey lurg shoh, derrey ghow Joseph yn chiassaghey, as v’eh feer doogh.

"One man, finding out where he heard this doctrine, on which he dwelt uniformly, and with such delight, went and asked Dr. Calamy to come and visit him. He came: but Joseph was now very weak, and had not spoken for some time; and though told of the doctor's arrival, be took no notice of him: but when the doctor began to speak to him, as soon as he heard the sound of his voice, he instantly sprang upon his elbows, and seizing him by the hands, exclaimed as loud as he could, with his now feeble and trembling voice, “O Sir! you are the friend of the Lord Jesus, whom I heard speak so well of him, and whom I love for what you said of him. Joseph is the chief of sinners; but it is a faithful saying, that Jesus Christ, the God who made all things, came into the world to save sinners, and why not Joseph? O pray to that Jesus for me; pray that he may save me! tell him that Joseph thinks that he loves him, for coming into the world to save such sinners as Joseph.” The doctor prayed. When he concluded, Joseph thanked him most kindly. He then put his hand under the pillow, and took an old rag, in which were tied up five guineas, and putting it into the Doctor's hand, (which he had kept all this while close in his,) he thus addressed him: “Joseph, in his folly, had laid this up to keep him in his old age; but Joseph will never see old age; take it., and divide it amongst the poor friends of the Lord Jesus; and tell them that Joseph gave it them for his sake who came into the world to save sinners, of whom he is the chief.” So saying, he reclined his head. His exertions in talking had been too much for him, so that he instantly expired.","Lurg va dooinney ennagh er gheddyn magh yn raad cheayll eh yn ynsagh shoh, mychione v’eh taggloo cha kinjagh as lesh theid y thaitnys, hie eh as ghuee eh er Saggyrt Calamy dy heet dy yeeaghyn eh.

"Dr. Calamy left this scene, but not without shedding tears over Joseph: and used to tell this little story with much feeling, as one of the most affecting occurrences he ever met with.","Cha daag Saggyrt Calamy yn boayl, fegooish shilley jeïr harrish Joseph; as v’eh cliaghtit dy insh yn coontey giare shoh, lesh lane ennaghtyn, as myr cooish ghow ny smoo dy ghreme er e chree, na nhee erbee ren ah rieau meeiteil rish.",3,,

"1 . Let us admire the sovereignty of Divine Grace. The whole congregation whether rich or poor, were sinners in the fight of a holy God, and stood equally in need of that salvation, which by the gospel, was preached to them. But while the elegant assembly heard it with listless inattention, the word of God came with demonstration of the Spirit and of power to the heart of Joseph, and fixed his attention to its infinite importance. To what can we ascribe this difference, but to the sovereign grace of Him who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy; who hath hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed to babes, and hath chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?",1. [1],3,,[1] The first paragraph of the first ‘observation’ is omitted in the Manx.
"To display the power and sovereignty of this grace, the Apostle tells us, that God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty, for the express purpose, that no flesh should glory in his presence, but that he that glorieth should glory only in the Lord. This is very different from the general views of men. There is a proneness in the human mind when convicted of sin, to do something in order to escape the wrath of God and merit his favour. Many go about to establish a righteousness of their own, not submitting to the righteousness of God ; while others endeavour by their own exertions to make their hearts better, and so prepare them for the reception of Christ. Joseph had no idea of such a way of salvation When asked about his heart, if there was no token for good about it, no saving change there ? “Ah no, (said he) Joseph can act nothing—Joseph has nothing to say for himself, but just that he is the chief of sinners, “ &c.",,3,,

"2. The gospel produces love to God and his people. Joseph had received the word, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God; and it wrought effectually in him believing it. He experienced the truth of the Apostle's assertion, “We love him because he first loved us.” “O pray, (said he,) to that Jesus for me ; pray that he may save me! tell him that Joseph thinks that he loves him for coming into the world to save such sinners as Joseph.” Whatever may be said about loving God for what he is in himself, it was a sense of the love of Christ manifested in saving sinners, that first attracted his attention, drew forth his warmest affections, and occupied all his thoughts. Thus it is with every sinner saved by sovereign grace. A sense of the love of Christ shed abroad in the heart by the Holy Spirit, infallibly produces love, and this is shewn by universal obedience to the will of God, and studying to adorn the doctrine of God by a life and conversation becoming the gospel. Joseph could not now manifest his love to God in this way, but he does it by shewing love to his people, and that because they were the friends of Jesus. When he heard Dr. Calamy's voice, he exclaimed, “O, sir, you are the friend of the Lord Jesus, whom I heard speak so well of him, and whom I love for what you said of him;” and to this profession of love he added a substantial proof, in giving to the poor friends of Jesus all he possessed in the world.","2.

"3. The gospel is sufficient to support the mind in the immediate prospect of death. Joseph did not comfort himself with the thought that he was no worse than his neighbours; and therefore, as God was merciful, he would be safe enough. The atonement of Christ was the only and exclusive ground of his hope and confidence in the view of death, judgment, and eternity. Being justified by faith, he had peace with God through the Lord Jesus Christ, and rejoiced in hope of the glory of God.","3. Ta’n sushtal fondagh dy chummal seose yn cree eer er broogh beaynid.

"Death is a subject of the last importance. It is appointed unto men once to die, but after death the judgment. Think of this, ye that forget God, and put far from you the day of death. Remember that your breath is in your nostrils; perhaps this night your soul may be required of you, and what then would be your situation? Be entreated then to consider your ways, and flee for refuge to the hope set before you in the gospel. It still remains a faithful saying, that Jesus, he who made all things, came into the world to save sinners, even the chief. And there is no other name given under heaven by which any can be saved.","Ta baase cooish jeh trimmid erskyn-insh. “Te er ny phointeil da deiney un cheayrt dy gheddyn baase, as ny lurg shen yn Briwnys.” Smooinee-jee er shoh, ooilley shiuish ta jarrood Jee, as ta coyrt baase foddey veue.
