"M. NEIGHBOUR, good-morrow. I find you have been early up, and diligently employed; your cattle fed, and servants at work. I see thriving in the world is a matter very near your heart.","B.

"P. Ay, Sir, all this is necessary. Meat and clothes must be provided; my Landlord’s rent must be paid; and this requires much care and labour.","F. Ta mee dy jarroo, as ta ooilley shoh ymmyrchagh. Sheign da beaghey as coamrey v’er ny cosney as sheign da maill ve eeckyt ass y thalloo; as cha nod shoh ve jeant fegooish lane kiarail as obbyr.",1,,
"M. I would by no means discourage your industry. It is your duty not to be slothful in business. But, you know, you have another calling besides husbandry: The soul must be fed and clothed too.",B.

"P.

"M. No particular reason to be suspicious of you more than of others. But when I look round, and observe the general unconcern about salvation in which men live, I am concerned for my fellow mortals: and with respect to you of this parish in particular, I think myself obliged to admonish you of your danger, that you may not die before you have obtained forgiveness of your sins through faith in Jesus Christ, and are made meet for an inheritance among them that are sanctified.","B.

"P. Lord, Sir! why should you entertain such uncharitable thoughts of us? ",F. Hiarn bannee shin! cre’n fa yinnagh shiu cur raad da lheid ny smooinaghtyn veeghiastyllagh j’in.,2,,
"M. Do not so abuse the word charity: it signifies the same as love. Now love does not require that we think well of every body, with or without reason, but that we wish and intend well to every body. If I gave myself no trouble about you, that is, if I were utterly void of charity, you would think me a very charitable man.","B. Ny gow yn fockle ghiastyllys ayns aght cha neu-cooie.

"P. But I hope you do not condemn us all : some of us indeed are wicked, swearing, drunken men; but we are not all so. You know yourself that I keep my church, and come sometimes to sacrament. I never hurted any man in my life, and pay every man his due.","F.

"M. And upon this you build your hopes of heaven? —If this is your foundation, I must plainly tell you, it will leave you hopeless in the day of trial. Let us examine it by the word of God. ","B.

"“You never did hurt to any man.” You mean, I suppose, you never robbed nor murdered any person; I do not: think you have; but still you have committed much sin, and done much hurt, not only to others, but especially to your own soul, by, great and numberless, nay, daily offences against the holy law of God. Nay, you have broken every one of his commandments.","“Cha ren mee rieau skielley da dooinney erbee.” T’ou cheet er liorish shoh nagh vel oo rieau er gheid, ny er n’yannoo dunverys.

P. Who could give you such an account of me?,F. Quoi oddagh ginsh diu lheid ny reddyn jeem’s?,2,,
"M. You yourself, last Sunday. When you heard me repeat the commandments, you made answer after each of them, Lord have mercy upon us, &c. Your calling for mercy was plainly acknowledging yourself guilty."," B. Oo hene er y doonaght s’jerree. Tra va mee fockley magh ny jeih annaghyn, dooyrt oo lurg dagh unnane jeu “Hiarn, jean myghin orrin.” Liorish geearree myghin ren oo dy foshlyt ghoaill rish dy row oo er vrishey ad ooilley.",3,,
"P. I never committed idolatry, murder, adultery—","F. Cha dug mee rieau ammys da jallooyn, cha ren mee rieau dunverys ny brishey poosey.",3,,
"M. Yes, all of them. Have you never loved any worldly thing more than God and his favour? nor feared any thing more than his displeasure, so as to neglect a known duty rather than draw upon yourself some temporal inconvenience? This was a breach of the first commandment. The second commandment respects the manner of expressing the devotion of the heart; and therefore whatever in your service has been unbecoming, such as wandering thoughts, carelessness and irreverence, as well as using images, is a breach of this commandment: so is also neglect of God’s service. And here you will not pretend, I suppose, to be not guilty. Consequently, your coming to church and sacrament in this careless unthinking manner, deserves rather to be reckoned among your sins, than trusted to for justification before God. But a few minutes ago, in my hearing, you took the Lord’s name in vain, using it needlessly, and without an awful sense of his majesty, of whom you spake. You have done the same perhaps ten thousand times in your life. This is a breach of the third commandment. Whenever you have neglected to attend on God’s worship on the sabbath without a necessary hindrance, suffered worldly thoughts to unfit you for God’s service, done worldly business on that day that might have been done on another, and neglected to devote the whole to God, by reading, hearing, prayer, meditation, and useful conversation —you have profaned the Lord’s day. The substance of these commandments is, thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart: But you have come short of this whenever you have not acted to the glory of God. Now what think you of your innocence with respect to the duties of the first table of the commandments?","B. Dy firrinagh t’ou er ve oolee jeu ooilley.

"M. You would not say so, if you understood the spirituality and extent of God’s commandments, as explained by our Lord in his Sermon on the Mount. There you find that wantonness in the eye or heart is esteemed (Matt. v. 28.) adultery in the sight of God; and causeless (Matt. v. 22.) anger, and especially injurious language, is accounted a degree of murder: and who can acquit himself of these?

"If you take the same method to understand the other commandments, all parts of your behaviour that are unsuitable to the station in which Providence hath placed you, all irreverence and proud censuring of your superiors, and all unkind and injurious treatment of those that are beneath you, will appear to be breaches of the fifth commandment. All evil speaking, rash censuring, and repeating of stories injurious to the character of others, are contrary to the ninth: and all murmuring and discontent, envy and greediness, are sins forbidden by the tenth.","My t’ou goaill yn aght cheddin dy hoiggal ny annaghyn elley nee dy chooilley ayrn jeh dty ymmyrkey nagh vel cooie gys y stayd huggey t’ou er dty eam, dy chooilley vee-arrym dauesyn t’ayns stayd s’yrjey na oo hene, as dy chooilley hranlaase orroosyn t’ayns stayd s’inshley, nee ooilley shoh jeeaghyn dy ve noi yn queiggoo anney; dy chooilley scammylt as skeeal ta jannoo aggair da ennym mie dty naboo noi yn nuyoo anney; as dy chooilley phlaiynt as tallagh, troo, as drogh-vian er ny lhiettal liorish y jeihoo anney.",4,,

I do not think you a thief or a robber: yet, have you never concealed the faults and bad properties of what you sold, when you knew that ignorance of these faults was the very thing that induced the person to buy? Nay, have you not often recommended your goods in such general terms, as were inconsistent with strict truth? Have you not cruelly taken advantage of the necessity of a needy seller, and beat down his ware much below its real value? These will certainly witness against you.","B.

"M. I fear your notions of God’s mercy are such as prevent true repentance. You seem to have entertained hopes of mercy, without being deeply sensible of your utter misery without it; to have applied the healing balsam, before you were wounded. This is what the Almighty styles healing the wound of his people slightly. Now you seem in this manner to have deceived yourself. You never saw yourself in a state of sin and death; you never saw sin odious; you were never greatly afraid of perishing, nor saw that there was no help or strength in yourself: therefore you never fled to him who is a Refuge from the storm. And, if you have never fled thus to Christ, as helpless and undone without him, it is plain that you are still without any saving interest in him.","B.

Have you not lived for a long time together as without God in the world? Instead of renouncing the world, the flesh, and the devil, have you not followed and been led by them? Have you not been led by the world in judging of things according to the opinions of men, in opposition to the word of God? Have you not in many things conformed to its customs contrary to the commands of God? Have you not frequently obeyed your carnal lusts and inclinations so as to violate frequently the pure law of God, if not by actual offences, yet by indulging evil thoughts, and living in lesser sins without concern? And has not the devil been for a considerable time your master, leading you to offend God by profaning his holy name and holy day; and that for the sake of such trifling pleasure, as plainly argues his ascendancy over you? And have you not continued still in these things with little or no concern, hoping, notwithstanding, that all would be well? Nay, is not this still in some measure your case? —I see you acknowledge it is, it is plain then your baptismal vow and covenant are broken, and there is an absolute necessity of turning unto God, and beginning all anew.","B.

"You never saw and felt your danger; consequently could never be so desirous of escaping it as is necessary. You always flattered yourself with some hopes that your state was safe, or certainly would be, when you lived a little better; which was at bottom depending on yourself. And with respect to the other branches of repentance, such as forsaking sin—it is evident to yourself you have lived without concern in some lesser habitual sins; and, as for turning to God, you were never sensible, that in the stream of your affections, and the general course of your life, you were turned from him. —Indeed (though you seem not to know it) the ruling principle in you, and every natural man, is a principle of sin and corruption. Instead of seeking to please God, you have all along been seeking to please yourself; to procure some gratification to corrupted nature, such as sensual delights, riches, worldly esteem, ease, or the like. This hath been the acting principle throughout your whole conduct, instead of obeying that command, Do all to the glory of God. Nay, if you search narrowly, you will find in your heart an enmity against God. For so saith the apostle, Rom. viii. 7. the carnal mind (and such is every man’s by nature) is enmity against God. And this enmity shews itself in opposing God’s will, by doing what he hath forbidden, and leaving undone what he hath commanded; and also in flying from God as your enemy, and endeavouring to hide yourself from him like Adam. Have you not passed days and weeks without one serious thought of God, though you were all that time receiving mercies at his hand? Have you not banished and suppressed such thoughts, when they have arisen in your mind? Have you not fled from serious thoughts of God and eternity, as enemies to your peace, and drowned them in worldly cares, vain conversation, and idle amusements? Have you not thus fled from God? ",,9,,
"You know you have. —Hitherto (suffer me to be plain with you) you have gone wrong, and have been insensible of your danger; deceived yourself, and spoken peace to your soul, when there was no peace. Now consider what you have heard from me, read your Bible, examine yourself, and pray unto God to give you a sense of your real state, and a right judgment in all things.

I was not sensible any such change had been wrought in me, and am therefore afraid I am still in the state of sin, in which, you told us, all men are by nature.","F.

"M. You have great reason to be afraid. I told you that those would be esteemed righteous on that day, who had fled to the Lord Jesus Christ for righteousness to justify them, and had been made holy by the spirit of God, creating in them a new heart, and had evidenced this change by an holy conversation through the remaining part of their life, how many or great soever their sins had been: and that the wicked were those that had lived and died without faith in Christ, and the indwellings of God’s spirit, however orderly and decent their conduct was.","B.

But if this mercy and acceptance through Jesus Christ were obtained before death, no man’s sins would be remembered against him on that day.

"M. The wicked, that is, they that lived and died without an humbling sense of their natural corruption and actual sins, so as never by faith to fly for refuge to God’s mercy in Christ, have, properly speaking, no good works to be mentioned, for all they do is from a wrong principle;[7] either from selfish and worldly ends, or in order to gain an interest in Christ, and pardon of their sins on account of their doings; which is seeking salvation by the law of works. On this account their works are not regarded, being not done in faith; nor proceeding from a principle of love; which principle none have till they are one with Christ, John xvii. 21. who is the true vine, and believers are the branches deriving life from him, John xv. 1. and without whom we can do nothing acceptable in God’s sight, John xv. 5. On the other hand, the righteous being themselves accepted through Christ, their sins are not mentioned because long before forgiven and blotted out: and their imperfect services, being accepted through Jesus their High Priest, who bears the iniquity of their holy things, receive at the hands of the bountiful Judge a reward of grace. So that that which principally distinguishes the godly from the ungodly, is, that the one is accepted as righteous, and has obtained forgiveness through Christ, according the new or gospel covenant: the other, never being deeply sensible of his sinful lost state (indeed too proud to acknowledge it) hath not applied for the mercy represented in the gospel, and so at the day of judgement stands on the foundation of the old covenant or law of good works, which requires perfect obedience: consequently he is without a Mediator, and without forgiveness, and therefore must be condemned.","B.

"M. I gave you two reasons for this: First, Because, though they are not the ground of any man’s acceptance, yet they shew a man to be in a justified state; for we cannot bear the fruit of holiness, unless we are in and abide in Christ, John xv. 4. And they who do not act righteously deceive themselves if they think themselves righteous: so that good works serve to distinguish believers from unbelievers. Secondly, Because the different degrees of fruitfulness[8] makes a difference between the godly themselves, so that God is pleased graciously to confer upon them different degrees of glory. That any man is at all saved is owing to his faith in the Redeemer: His degree of glory is proportioned to his fruitfulness and diligence in the vineyard. .","B. Hug mee daa oyr son shoh.

I find in myself a strong inclination to many sins, though I am convinced that I deserve God’s wrath on account of complying with these inclinations heretofore. Indeed it is much better with me now than it was. Formerly I have been led by my own wicked heart to delight in idle company; to talk of myself in an empty vain manner; to be greedy after the world; to pass slightly over, or entirely neglect, prayer and other duties, as a tedious burden, and be guilty of other sins.

"The words you mentioned are in the prophet Hosea, xiv. 4. They were perhaps spoken more immediately of the restoration of the captive Jews: but they contain a sweet promise perfectly in the gospel strain, and are therefore free for every humble soul to embrace by faith. The Prophet, you see, at verse 1, 2, 3, exhorts the people to repentance and humiliation for sin; O Israel, return unto the LORD thy GOD; for thou hast fallen by iniquity. Take with you words, and turn to the Lord. Say unto him, take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously —For in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. Now, as God hath given you a sense of your sinful, helpless state, and a desire of turning to him, like this which the Prophet describes as preparatory to an answer of peace, I hope the following promise belongs to you: I will heal their backslidings, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him, verse 4. I hope too, that the comfort, which you found in applying the promise to yourself by a particular faith, proceeded from the Spirit of God: in the same manner as I look on that conviction of sin, which filled you with fear and self-abasement, when you called to mind your sinfulness, and God’s Judgment denounced against sinners, to be the work of the same Spirit. For it is he that convinceth the world of sin and of righteousness. But this I must tell you: all these feelings are to be suspected, till we see what fruit follows in the heart and life. For, though these are sometimes owing to the Spirit of God, and come well recommended, when, as in your case, they are so closely connected with the word of God; yet the enemy of souls sometimes imitates these sensible experiences in order to deceive. And, it is impossible to say how much our natural. temper and spirits may contribute thereto.","Ta ny goan t’ou er loayrt jeu ayns lioar y Phadeyr Hosea  xiv.

"M. Satan, I tell you, sometimes puts on the appearance of an angel of light, in order to deceive. Those sensible experiences sometimes vouchsafed by the Spirit of God, and impressions made on men’s minds, of which sort are what the scriptures term peace in believing, and joy in the Holy Ghost: these the enemy sometimes imitates, and thereby deludes hypocrites into spiritual pride, and even. the godly sometimes, so as to puff them up, and make them secure and careless. But there are two tokens of grace, which the devil will not, cannot effect: these are an holy heart, steadily hating sin; and an holy life, having respect to all God’s commandments. Have these, and evidence the one by the other; and continue for some considerable time thus to adorn your profession. —Then I shall not have the least doubt but you are in a state of grace. ",[16],20,,[16] The Manx omits the Minister’s answer here; the Parishioner’s remarks continue without a break.

"My first advice is, be humble, and walk humbly with thy GOD. Let the remembrance of your past life of sin and folly still cover you with shame. Recollect the many aggravating circumstances of a life hitherto spent in rebellion against God; during all which he daily heaped mercies upon you and yours; giving food and raiment, health and strength; and continued these mercies to you, while you forgot the hand that gave them, and returned evil for good. He spared you in all your provocations; and at last opened your eyes to see your danger, stirred you up to avoid it, and now hath given you a good, hope, through grace, of obtaining eternal life., Thus compare together what God hath done, and you deserved, and thus learn humility. Keep a watchful eye also upon the remains of indwelling sin still in you. And let every sinful Inclination, vain thought, backwardness to duty, and failure in it, teach you to be humble and fear. Thus, distrusting yourself, look up to God for continual support, like an helpless little child; expecting, through the mediation of Jesus Christ, to be assisted in every time of need.","Shoh yn chied coyrle ta mee cur dhyt. “Shooyl dy imlee marish dty Yee.”  Lhig da cooniaghtyn jeh peccah as ommijys dty vea t’er n’holl shiaghey foast oo y coodaghey lesh nearey.

"My next advice is, keep a conscience void of offence. If you have wronged any man, be not ashamed to acknowledge it; and according to your power make restitution, that the accursed thing may not cleave to you. Take heed that you grieve not the Spirit of God by unholy walking, lest you provoke him to forsake you. To this end, watch over your heart, repress its first inclinations to sin, and be watchful against temptation from without; fixing your eye especially on the sin with which you have heretofore been most easily beset. If at any time sin prevail against you, do not endeavour to forget it, or hide it in your bosom: But go to God immediately: take shame to yourself; plead the gospel promises to returning sinners, looking unto Jesus Christ as your all-sufficient sacrifice, and advocate with the Father; and never cease wrestling with God in prayer, until he again speaks peace to your troubled soul, and fill you with a greater fear of offending him.","Ny sodjey, ta mee choyrt coyrle dhyt dy “reayll cooinsheanse gyn loght.” My t’ou er n’yannoo aggair da dooinney erbee, ny gow nearey dy ghoaill rish, as choud’s oddys oo jean lhiassaghey, nagh jean y red cursit lhiantyn hood.

"As I hope you are now planted in God’s vineyard, be fruitful. Bear on your heart a sense of God’s love to sinners in Jesus Christ. Consider in particular, what God hath done for you, in calling you out of darkness into his marvellous light. Remember how you lay fast asleep in sin and fatal security, when God awaked you to see your danger and escape it. Think what would have been your condition in eternity, if God had left you to yourself. Think how many still go on in the same fatal path in which you trod. And let the sense of God’s distinguishing love to you excite you to some return. Love him, because he first loved you. And let love to your heavenly Father influence your thoughts, and words, and actions.","Myr ta mee treishteil dy vel oo nish er dty hoiaghey ayns Garey-feeyney Yee, bee messoil.

"Let your meditations of God be sweet and frequent. Lift up your heart to him that seeth in secret, and trieth the heart and reins. Seek a close communion with the Father of your spirit: and to this end, endeavour to withdraw your thoughts from worldly things, and to raise your affections from earth to heaven, to those things which are not seen but by the eye of faith. That thus you may walk by faith, guided by it all the eye of the soul, and raised by it to heavenly-mindedness; so as to love and delight in God.","Lhig da dty chommeeys rish Jee ve kinjagh as gerjoilagh.

"Shew a particular regard for them that are of the household of faith, all the sincerely godly, for Christ’s sake. For as all men were originally created after God’s image, in them is this image in some measure restored. These therefore in a peculiar manner belong to Christ, being washed from their sins in his blood, and sanctified by his spirit. And to animate you to greater diligence in this work and labour of love, view often with the eyes of faith the glorious reward set before you, the eternal weight of glory to be bestowed on that day when Christ shall reward acts of mercy and love, done in his name, as if done to himself.","Soilshee graih er-lheh “dauesyn ta jeh lught-thie yn chredjue” ooilley ny ta dy firrinagh crauee, er graih Chreest.

"Quickened by this principle, and encouraged by this prospect, strive to grow in knowledge, and purity, and faith, and love, and godly fear; in meekness and every christian grace. Study to promote God’s glory, the welfare of all men, and such a disposition in your own soul as may render you meet to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints of light. And, in order to promote this work of sanctification in you, wait for God’s blessing and grace in a conscientious use of the ordinances, in prayer public and private, hearing and reading God’s word; and confirm your covenant with God at his table. Thus may you hope to be a fruitful vine, and experience in your soul those blessings, which the Prophet immediately adds to that promise of free mercy, in which you have found so much consolation. Hosea xiv. 5, 6, 7, I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon; growing upwards by faith and love, and downwards by humility. His branches shall spread; and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. They that dwell under his shadow shall return from all their wanderings: they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent (or blossom) therefore shall be as the vine of Lebanon, beautiful, fruitful, and pleasant in God’s sight.","Er ny vioghey liorish graih as er ny ghriennaghey lesh y treishteil dy gloyr, streeu dy aase ayns tushtey as glennid, ayns chredjue, as graih, as aggle; ayns meenid as dy chooilley ghrayse Chreestee.

Not only the careless and prophane will sneer and ridicule you, but the more decent formalists also will be highly offended. They will say in their hearts, as the Pharisees of old: In doing this, in going out of the common fashionable road, and pretending to uncommon strictness, thou condemnest us also.

Holy angels will be employed as your guardians; and all the truly godly will be your loving brethren and ready friends. They that are for you are more than they that are against you.
