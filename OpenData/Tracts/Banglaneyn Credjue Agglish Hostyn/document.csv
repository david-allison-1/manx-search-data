HIS MAJESTY’S DECLARATION,SLATTYS Y REE.,,
"Being by God’s Ordinance, according to our just Title, Defender of the Faith, and Supreme Governour of the Church, within these our Dominions, We hold it most agreeable to this our Kingly Office, and our own religious Zeal, to conserve and maintain the Church committed to our Charge, in Unity of true Religion, and in the Bond of Peace; and not to suffer unnecessary Disputations, Altercations, or Questions to be raised, which may nourish Faction both in the Church and Commonwealth. We have therefore, upon mature Deliberation, and with the Advice of so many of Our Bishops as might conveniently be called together, thought fit to make this Declaration following:","Myr ta shin, liorish oardagh Yee, dy cairagh Fendeilagh y Chredjue, as Ardreiltagh yn Agglish, cheu-sthie jeh ny Reamyn shoh, ta shin jeeaghyn er myr smoo cooie da’n oik reeoil ain, as nyn ghraih jeean er craueeaght, dy choadey as dy reayll yn Agglish t’er ny choyrt fo nyn gurrym ayns unnanys y chredjue firrinagh, as ayns kianley’n chee, as gyn lhiggey da arganyn, jengleyrys, as feyshtyn neu-ymmyrchagh, dy v’er ny hroggal, oddys coyrt oyr da streu as reynn, chammah ayns yn Agglish as fud y Thea.

"That the Articles of the Church of England (which have been allowed and authorized heretofore, and which Our Clergy generally have subscribed unto) do contain the true Doctrine of the Church of England agreeable to God’s Word: which We do therefore ratify and confirm, requiring all our loving Subjects to continue in the uniform Profession thereof, and prohibiting the least difference from the said Articles; which to that end We command to be new printed, and this Our Declaration to be published therewith.","Dy vel Banglaneyn Credjue Agglish Hostyn (va roïe soit magh, as orroo ta ny Aspickyn as ny Saggyrtyn ain er chordail,) goaill stiagh ynsagh firrinagh Agglish Hostyn, cordail rish Goo Yee: as ad shoh ta shin er-y-fa shen dy hickyraghey, coyrt sarey da ooilley yn thea graihagh ain dy hannaghtyn kinjagh ayns goaill roo, as gyn lhiggey daue dy scarrey ayns y thowse sloo veih ny Banglaneyn cheddin: as er-yn-oyr shoh ta shin sarey ad dy ve prentit ass-y-noa, as shoh yn slattys ain dy v’er ny hoiaghey magh maroo.",,
"That We are Supreme Governour of the Church of England: And that if any difference arise about the external Policy, concerning the Injunctions, Canons, and other Constitutions whatsoever thereto belonging, the Clergy in their Convocation is to order and settle them, having first obtained leave under Our Broad Seal so to do: and We approving their said Ordinances and Constitutions; providing that none be made contrary to the Laws and Customs of the Land.","Dy vel shin Ardreiltagh Agglish Hostyn: as my ta streu erbee girree mychione Oardaghyn Cheumooie yn Agglish, mychione ny Leighyn, Canonyn, as Oardaghyn elley bentyn huic, dy vel ny Saggyrtyn ayns y Slane Chaglym cooidjagh oc, dy reaghey as dy hickyraghey ad, lurg daue hoshiaght v’er gheddyn kied fo’n Broad Seal ain dy yannoo myr shen; as shinin soiaghey jeh ny oardaghyn as ny leighyn oc, er conaant nagh bee veg jeu noi leighyn as cliaghtaghyn y Cheer.

",
"That out of Our Princely Care that the Churchmen may do the Work which is proper unto them, the Bishops and Clergy, from time to time in Convocation, upon their humble Desire, shall have Licence under Our Broad Seal to deliberate of, and to do all such Things, as, being made plain by them, and assented unto by Us, shall concern the settled Continuance of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England now established; from which We will not endure any varying or departing in the least Degree.","Veih nyn garail reeoil dy vod Reiltee yn Agglish jannoo yn obbyr ta cair daue, yiow ny Aspickyn as Saggyrtyn, veih traa gy traa, ayns Convocation er nyn accan imlee, kied fo’n Broad Seal ain, dy choyrt nyn aigney dy chielley, as dy yannoo ooilley lheid ny reddyn as, tra vees ad jeant cronnal lioroosyn, as lowit liorinyn, nee bentyn rish cummal seose ny-yei shoh, Ynsagh as Reill Agglish Hostyn, nish er ny hickyraghey liorish y leigh; veih cha jean mayd surranse caghlaa ny chyndaa ayns yn aght sloo.","Veih nyn garail reeoil dy vod Reiltee yn Agglish jannoo yn obbyr ta cair daue, yiow ny Aspickyn as Sagyrtyn, veih traa gy traa, ayns Convocation er nyn accan imlee, kied fo’n Broad Seal ain, dy choyrt nyn aigney dy chielley, as dy yannoo ooilley lheid ny reddyn as, tra vees ad jeant cronnal lioroosyn, as lowit liorinyn, nee bentyn rish cummal seose ny-yei shoh, Ynsagh as Reill Agglish Hostyn, nish er ny hickyraghey liorish y leigh; veih cha jean mayd surranse caghlaa ny chyndaa ayns yn aght sloo.",
"That for the present, though some differences have been ill raised, yet we take comfort in this, that all Clergymen within Our Realm have always most willingly subscribed to the Articles established; which is an argument to Us, that they all agree in the true, usual, literal meaning of the said Articles; and that even in those curious points, in which the present differences lie, men of all sorts take the Articles of the Church of England to be for them; which is an argument again, that none of them intend any desertion of the Articles established.","Ga son y traa t’ayn dy vel caghlaaghyn ennagh er ve dy aggairagh er nyn droggal, ny-yeih te gerjagh dooin dy vel ooilley ny Saggyrtyn cheusthie jeh’n Ream ain, dy kinjagh as dy arryltagh er chordail fo-laue er Banglaneyn Credjue yn Agglish ain soit magh liorish y leigh; cooid ta prowal dy vel ad ooilley goaill ny Banglaneyn cheddin ayns nyn vree[1] firrinagh cadjin, as cronnal: as eer ayns ny ayrnyn follit shen, orroo ta caghlaaghyn smooniaght, ta sleih jeh dy chooilley horch goaill ny Banglanyn Credjue cheddin myr er y cheu ocsyn; as ta shoh prowal sodjey nagh vel aigney ec veg jeu dy choyrt cooyll rish ny Banglaneyn shoh.",,"[1] nyn vree] the first of three cases of lenition where nasalization would be standard. The others are nyn Ven-Rein and er nyn hickyraghey, both in the Ratification. We find correct nyn mree in the next paragraph."
"That therefore in these both curious and unhappy differences, which have for so many hundred years, in different times and places, exercised the Church of Christ, We will, that all further curious search be laid aside, and these disputes shut up in God’s promises, as they be generally set forth to us in the holy Scriptures, and the general meaning of the Articles of the Church of England according to them. And that no man hereafter shall either print, or preach, to draw the Article aside any way, but shall submit to it in the plain and full meaning thereof: and shall not put his own sense or comment to be the meaning of the Article, but shall take it in the literal and grammatical sense.","Shen-y-fa ayns ny caghlaaghyn mee-vaynrey as neu-vondeishagh shoh, ta son whilleen cheead blein, ayns ymmodee imbaghyn as ynnydyn, er voirey Agglish Chreest, yn aigney ain te, dy bee dy chooilley ronsagh sodjey er ny choyrt dy lhiattee, as ny arganeyn shoh ve jeight seose ayns gialdynyn Yee, myr t’ad dy cadjin soit roin ayns ny Scriptyryn Casherick, as bree cadjin Banglaneyn Credjue Agglish Hostyn, cordail roo.

"There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and Preserver of all things both visible and invisible.

"II. Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man.","2. Mychione y Goo, ny Mac Yee va jeant ny Ghooinney firrinagh.",,
"The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father, took Man’s nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.","Ren y Mac, ta Goo yn Ayr, er ny gheddyn liorish yn Ayr er dy rieau, yn Jee firrinagh as dy bragh farraghtyn, jeh’n un vree marish yn Ayr, goaill er dooghys dooinney ayns breïn y Voidyn Moirrey jeh’n stoo eck: myr shen dy row daa ghooghys slane as firrinagh, ta shen dy ghra, dooghys Yee, as dooghys ghooinney sniemmit cooidjagh ayns un phersoon, gyn dy bragh dy ve er nyn rheynn, jeh ta un Chreest, Jee firrinagh as dooinney firrinagh, ren surranse, v’er ny chrossey, er ny varroo, as er ny oanluckey, dy yannoo coardail eddyr Jee as shinyn, as dy ve ny oural, cha nee ynrican son y peccah ayn va shin ruggit, agh myrgeddin son ny peccaghyn jeant liorish deiney hene.",,

"Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the holy Scripture we do understand those Canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.","Ta Scriptyr Casherick goaill stiagh dy chooilley nhee ta ymmyrchagh gys Saualtys: myr shen nagh vel nhee erbee nagh vel er ny lhaih ayns y Scriptyr, ny oddys ve’r ny phrowal liorish, dy v’er ny hirrey jeh dooinney erbee dy lhisagh eh v’er ny chredjal myr banglane dy chredjue, ny ve smooinnit ymmyrchagh gys saualtys.

"The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any Common-wealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Commandments which are called Moral.","Cha vel y Chenn Chonaant noi yn Chonaant Noa: son chammah ayns y Chen Chonaant as y Chonaant Noa ta’n vea dy bragh farraghtyn chebbit da sheelnaue liorish Creest, ta’n ynrican Fer ta loayrt eddyr Jee as dooinney, myr t’eh chammah Jee as Dooinney.

"Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is ingendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God’s wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek, phronema sarkos, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.","Cha vel peccah yn dooghys ain shassoo ayns geiyrt er Adam, (myr ta ny Pelagianee dy fardailagh loayrt,) agh te loght as broid dooghys dy chooilley ghooinney ta er ny ruggey jeh sluight Adam, liorish ta dooinney er n’gholl feer foddey veih e chied ynrickys, as dy dooghyssagh lhiantyn gys olk; myr shen dy vel yn eill geearree dy kinjagh noi’n spyrryd; as shen-y-fa ayns dy chooilley unnane ruggit ayns y theihll, te toilliu corree as briwnys Yee.

"Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself once made, should take away the sins of the world, and sin, as Saint John saith, was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.","Va Creest ayns firrinys nyn ghooghys jeant casley rooinyn ayns dy chooilley nhee, er-lhimmey jeh peccah, voish v’eh dy bollagh seyr, chammah ayns e eill, as ayns e spyrryd.

"Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.","Cha vel dy chooilley pheccah baaish jeant jeh nyn yione lurg Bashtey, peccah noi yn Spyrryd Noo, as nagh vod v’er ny leih, Shen-y-fa cha vel gioot arrys dy v’er ny lhiettal veih nyn lheid as ta tuittym ayns peccah lurg Bashtey.

Wherefore, they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God’s purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God’s mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.","Ta Kiarail ro-laue Yee jeh deiney gys bea yn kiarail dy-bragh-farraghtyn echey, liorish (roish my va undinyn y theihll er nyn soiaghey,) t’eh dy kinjagh er chiarail, liorish e aigney keillit voinyn, dy eaysley veih mollaght as coayl-anmey dy-bragh-farraghtyn nyn lheid as t’eh er reih ayns Creest ass sheelnaue, as dy chur-lesh ad liorish Creest gys saualtys dy-bragh-farraghtyn, myr siyn jeant son ymmyd ooasle.

"As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God’s Predestination, is a most dangerous downfal, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either into desperation, or into wretchlessness[4] of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.","Myr ta smooinaghtyn crauee er Kiarail ro-laue Yee, as e reih arryltagh j’in ayns Creest, lane dy gherjagh millish, eunyssagh, as erskyn-insh, da sleih crauee, as da nyn lheid as ta gennaghtyn ayndoo hene bree Spyrryd Chreest, smaghtaghey obbraghyn yn eill, as nyn oltyn thallooinagh, as troggal nyn aignaghyn gys reddyn ard as flaunyssagh; chammah dy vel eh dy mooar niartaghey as shickyraghey nyn gredjue jeh Saualtys dy bragh-farraghtyn dy v’er ny chosney trooid Creest, as myrgeddin dy vel eh dy breeoil greesaghey nyn ghraih gys Jee: myr shen son sleih ta shirrey dy ve creeney erskyn ny ta scruit as jeh aigney foalley, as fegooish Spyrryd Chreest, dy reayll dy kinjagh roish nyn sooillyn, briwnys kiarail-ro-laue Yee, t’eh ribbey erskyn-towse dangeyragh, liorish ta’n drogh-spyrryd eddyr ceau ad ayns mee-hreishteil, ny ayns towse smoo dy neughlennid bea, chiart cha dangeyragh as mee-hreishteil.",,"[4] wretchlessness] i.e. recklessness, disregard, carelessness.

Philip Moore, delaying his ordination to the ministry. ‘He was not ordained priest till 1739 [at the age of 34]. The reason of this appears to have been that he refused to assent to the dogma that it was impossible that the heathen and the unbaptised could be saved’ (Moore, Manx Worthies ‘Philip Moore’). "
"They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature.

Neither is the effect of Christ’s ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God’s gifts diminished from such as by faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ’s institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.","Ga ayns Yn Agglish foshlit ta’n vooinjer veechrauee dy kinjagh ry-gheddyn mastey’n vooinjer chrauee, as ny cheayrtyn ta’n pooar smoo ec ny meechrauee ayns shirveish y Goo as ny Sacramentyn; ny-yeih myr nagh vel ad cooilleeney yn oik oc ayns yn ennym oc-hene, agh ayns ennym Chreest, as shirveish liorish y sarey as y phooar echeysyn, foddee mayd ymmyd y yannoo jeh’n chirveish oc, chammah ayns clashtyn Goo Yee, as ayns goaill ny Sacramentyn.

XXVII. Of Baptism.,27. Mychione Bashtey.,,
"Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is also a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.","Ta Bashtey cha nee ynrican cowrey jeh nyn gredjue, as jeh’n lhiettrimys liorish ta Creesteenyn er nyn gronnaghey veih feallagh elley nagh vel er nyn mashtey, agh te myrgeddin cowrey jeh nyn ruggey-reesht; liorish, myr liorish saase, t’adsyn ta dy cooie er nyn mashtey soit stiagh ayns yn Agglish: ta ny gialdynyn jeh leih peccaghyn, as jeh nyn doaltanys myr cloan dy Yee liorish y Spyrryd Noo, dy foshlit signit as sealit; ta credjue er ny hickyraghey, as grayse er ny vishaghey liorish padjer gys Jee.

XXVIII. Of the Lord’s Supper.,28. Mychione Shibber y Chiarn.,,
"The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ’s death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.","Ta Shibber y Chiarn, cha nee ynrican cowrey jeh’n ghraih lhisagh ve ec Creesteenyn yn derrey yeh gys y jeh elley, agh ny sleaïe te ny Hacrament jeh nyn Gionnaghey-reesht liorish baase Chreest: myr shen t’adsyn ta goaill eh dy cooie, dy feeu, as lesh credjue, goaill ayrn jeh Corp Chreest ayns yn Arran t’er ny vrishey, as myrgeddin goaill ayrn jeh Fuill Chreest ayns y Chappan dy vannaght.",,
"Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.","Cha vod Transubstantiation (ny caghlaa stoo arran as feeyn) ayns Shibber y Chiarn ve er ny phrowal liorish y Scriptyr Casherick; agh te dy baghtal noi goan y Scriptyr, stroie dooghys y Sacrament, as te er choyrt oyr da ymmodee smooniaghtyn fardailagh.","Cha vod Transubstantiation (ny caghlaa stoo arran as feeyn) ayns Shibber y Chiarn ve er ny phrowal liorish y Scriptyr Casheric; agh te dy baghtal noi goan y Scriptyr, stroie dooghys y Sacrament, as te er choyrt oyr da ymmodee smooniaghtyn fardailagh.",
"The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.","Ta Corp Chreest er ny choyrt, er ny ghoaill, as er ny ee, ayns Shibber y Chiarn, ynrican lurg aght flaunyssagh as spyrrydoil.

"The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.","Ta ny meechrauee as nyn lheid as ta fegooish credjue bioal, ga dy vel ad dy foshlit broo lesh nyn veeacklyn yn Sacrament jeh Corp as Fuill Chreest, (myr ta’n dooinney crauee Augustine gra,) ny-yeih cha vel ad er aght erbee goaill ayrn jeh Creest: agh ny sleaïe t’ad gee as giu cowrey, ny Sacrament, jeh lheid y red ooasle, gys nyn gheyrey hene.",,

"The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the parts of the Lord’s Sacrament, by Christ’s ordinance and commandment, ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.","Cha vel Cappan y Chiarn dy ve er ny lhiettal veih’n pobble; son lhisagh dagh ayrn jeh Sacrament y Chiarn, liorish oardagh as sarey Chreest, ve shirveishit er Creesteenyn ooilley colaik.",,

"The Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.","Ta Oural Chreest chebbit un keayrt yn kionnaghey-reesht shen, as lhiassaghey fondagh, son ooilley peccaghyn y slane seihll, chammah peccah yn dooghys ain, as peccah jeant liorin hene; as cha vel lhiassaghey elley son peccah agh shen ny-lomarcan.

XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests.,32. Mychione Poosey Saggyrtyn.,,
"Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God’s Law, either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.","Cha vel Aspickyn, Saggyrtyn, ny Shirveishee, er nyn sarey liorish Leigh Yee, eddyr dy vreearey noi Poosey, ny dy reayll ad-hene veih: shen-y-fa ta kied ocsyn, myr t’ec dy chooilley Chreestee elley, dy phoosey cordail rish nyn aigney hene, myr nee ad smooniaghtyn y stayd cheddin dy ve ny ’scooie dy choyrt craueeaght er y hoshiaght.",,

"That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a Judge that hath authority thereunto.","Lhisagh yn persoon shen, ta liorish briwnys foshlit yn Agglish dy cooie giarit jeh veih unnanys yn Agglish, ve goit liorish slane sheshaght ny Credjuee, myr Anchreestee as Publican, derrey t’eh dy foshlit goit stiagh reesht ayns yn Agglish, liorish Pennys, as liorish Briw t’ayns pooar dy ghoaill eh stiagh.",,

XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church.,34. Mychione Oardaghyn yn Agglish.,,
"It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, and utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed according to the diversities of countries, times, and men’s manners, so that nothing be ordained against God’s Word. Whosoever through his private judgement, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the traditions and ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak brethren.","Cha vel eh ymmyrchagh dy beagh Oardaghyn jeh’n un sorch ayns dy chooilley ynnyd; son ayns dy chooilley earish ta caghlaaghyn dy Oardaghyn er ve ayn, as foddee ad ve caghlait cordail rish ny caglaaghyn dy ashoonyn, imbaghyn, as cliaghtaghyn gheiney, myr shen nagh bee nhee erbee er ny oardaghey noi Goo Yee.
