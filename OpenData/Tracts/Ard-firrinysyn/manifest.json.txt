  "notes": "A Methodist Pamphlet - partially taken from Wesley\u0027s \u0027Thoughts on the current scarcity of provisions\u0027. Temperance leaflet from circa 1847, printed by Sherriff and Russell, author; Sheshaght Slane-Obbaltys skeery Andreays. Total Abstinence Society. Circa 1847. Note: this is a re-translation into English. This piece was also printed in Mona\u2019s Herald, Wednesday, March 18, 1885; Page: 8:  with the following introduction; \u201CJohn Wesley\u2019s Instructions To Methodists: The following condensed account of the principles laid down by John Wesley for the guidance of his followers, in regard to the Temperance question, was translated into Manx, for the Kirk Andreas Total Abstinence Society, in 1847, and circulated amongst its members. It has now been re-translated into English by Wm. Kneen, Town Missionary.\u201D There is no known existing example of the first edition of \u2018Ard-Firrinysyn\u2019, but as the publishers Sherriff \u0026 Russell ceased trading in 1849, the second edition could only have been published between 1847 and 1849. As large parts of the piece are direct translations of Wesley\u2019s or other\u2019s writings, the translation given here follows those works where possible, and is not Wm. Kneen\u2019s 1885 translation. The piece was also published, in serial form and with a different translation, in the Isle of Man Examiner\u2019s Manx language Column in July, August and September of 1899.",
