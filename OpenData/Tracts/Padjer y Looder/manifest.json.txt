  "notes": "I have consulted two editions of the English text. One version has at the end: Sold by Lincoln \u0026 Edmands, No. 53 Cornhill. Another is Liverpool Religious Tract Society, No. 70. Apart from the punctuation, the texts are similar, though not identical.  \r\nI follow the Liverpool edition of Tilling, who also printed some of the Manx tracts. The wording and punctuation of the Manx more closely matches Tilling\u2019s edition.\r\n",
