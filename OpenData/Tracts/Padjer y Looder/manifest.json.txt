	"notes": "I have consulted two editions of the English text. One version has at the end: Sold by Lincoln & Edmands, No. 53 Cornhill. Another is Liverpool Religious Tract Society, No. 70. Apart from the punctuation, the texts are similar, though not identical.  
I follow the Liverpool edition of Tilling, who also printed some of the Manx tracts. The wording and punctuation of the Manx more closely matches Tilling’s edition.
