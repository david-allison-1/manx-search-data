"It is very sad to consider, not only how few Nations there are in the World, which profess Christianity, but also of those who do profess it, how few there are comparatively that live according to their Profession : Wherefore it well becomes all Christ’s faithful Servants, especially the Ministers of his Gospel, to use their utmost Endeavours by Life and Doctrine, by public and private Exhortations, by Preaching and Writing, and by all the Ways they are capable of, to promote true Piety and Holiness amongst all sorts of Men, whether High or Low, Rich or Poor, without which no Man can be happy, either in this World, or that which is to come.","Te feer trimshagh dy smooinaghtyn, cha nee ynrycan cre’n earroo fardalagh dy Ashoonyn t’ayns y theihll ta goaill-rish y Chredjue Creestee, agh myrgeddyn jeh ny Ashoonyn shen ta goaill-rish, cre’n earroo fardalagh ayns cosolagh ta leeideil nyn mea cordail rish nyn Gredjue : Shen-y-fa te red feer jesh da ooilley sharvaantyn firrinagh Chreest, er-skyn ooilley da Shirveishee e Hushtal, dy yannoo ooilley ny t’ayns nyn booar liorish nyn Ymmyrkey-bea as Ynsagh, liorish nyn Goyrle dy foshlit as er lheh, liorish nyn Breacheil as nyn Screeu, as liorish dy chooilley aght oddys ad, dy chur Craueeaght as Casherickys firrinagh er y hoshiaght mastey dy chooilley cheint dy leih, edyr ard ny injil, boght ny berchagh, fegooish y Chraueeaght as y Chasherickys cheddyn cha vod dooinney erbee ve maynrey, edyr ayns y theihll shoh ny ayns y theihll ta ry heet.",,3,3,
"And though I well know that, Thanks be to God, we abound with Multitudes of excellent Books written to this End : yet are not such short Instructions as these that follow to be condemned as useless, since they will, it is likely, be more generally dispersed, and that amongst the very meanest of the People, and may more easily be read and remembered by such as have neither Time to read large Books, nor Money to buy them.","As ga dy vel fyss feer vie aym dy vel, booise gys Jee, palchey dy lioaryn mie ny vud ain scruit son yn Oyr shoh ; foast cha vel leid y Choyrle ghiare as ta dy heet ny lurg shoh dy ve deyrit myr gyn ymmyd, fakin dy vod y lioar veg shoh, te laik, as y Choyrle t’ayn-jee ve ny smoo er ny skeailey, as shen fud yn ayrn s’boghtey dy leih, as foddee ad ve ny sassey er nyn lhaih as cooinaghtyn freailt jeu liorish nyn leid ocsyn as nagh vel Tra oc dy lhaih lioaryn mooarey, ny argid dy chionnaghey ad.",,3,3,

"And may it please God to give a Blessing to such a mean Undertaking as this, and succeed it to the Good of Souls, I shall little regard the Censures of the Curious ; [1]remembering the Saying I have somewhere met with of a devout Writer, to this purpose, That he was desirous his Book should be scattered abroad upon Pedlars Stalls, and thence come into the Hands of common People, for the Increase of Knowledge and Piety, rather than be solemnly laid up and buried in the Libraries of the Learned.","As my scooidsaave lesh Jee bannaght y choyrt da leid yn obbyr fardalagh as ta shoh, as eh y vishaghey son foays anmeenyn, s’beg geill verryms da ny foiljyn yow Fer-ynsee erbee mooaralagh da’n lioar shoh",,4,3,[1] The last sentence is not rendered in the Manx.

"To Man therefore he has given the Use of Reason, chiefly to fit him for Religion, and to render him capable of knowing, loving, and serving his great Creator and Benefactor : And it is Religion which makes the great Difference betwixt a Man and a Beast : For brute Creatures have no Knowledge of God, no Regard to him, but are wholly led by their Senses, and mind nothing else but what is before them here in this World.","Da dooinney er-y-fa shen te er chur pooar dy yannoo ymmyd jeh resoon, er-skyn ooilley dy yannoo Eh cooie son Credjue, as dy chur ’sy phooar echey dy chur enney er, dy chur graih da, as dy hirveish e Er-croo as e Charrey mooar : As she Credjue ta jannoo’n caghlaa mooar ta eddyr dooinney as beagh : Son cha vel ec cretooryn gyn resoon veg y tushtey jeh Jee, ny veg y gheill da, agh t’ad ooilley cooidjagh er nyn leeideil liorish pooaraghyn dooghyssagh nyn girp, as cha vel geill oc da nhee erbee agh da ny ta kiongoyrt roo ayns y theihll shoh.",,7,6,

The word is evidently a relative of the adj. geyre, G. geur and such a noun occurs in ScG. with the appropriate sense ‘edge, sharpness’ but m.; for a f. [as indicated by yn gheyr] we require the derivative géire ‘sharpness, bitterness’. Cf. pian as geyr 30.6.’ Thomson does not note Cregeen’s dy gheir, s. of smart or pain. G’ and ‘gyersnagh, s. m. a smart; pl. -yn.’ The spelling geir might suggest a slender r, although representation of this is not consistent in Classical Manx orthography, and still less in Cregeen, as the contrast seems to have been in the process of being lost. Loss of final schwa from géire might require explanation, as this is not usual in original bisyllables in Manx outside certain environments, such as following clusters of sonorants, such as oarn ‘barley’, G. eorna; arn ‘sloe, G. airne; Baarle ‘English’, G. Béarla (and is not consistent even in this environment, as baarney ‘gap’, G. bearna, cf. Sc. beàrn). Elsewhere in bisyllables the schwa is usually retained, so caashey ‘cheese’, G. cáise (again cf. loss in Sc. càis); carrey ‘friend’, G. cara; kiuney ‘calm’, G. ciúine, etc.; genney ‘dearth’, G. gainne (from gann, Manx goa(u)n). The last two would be parallel formations to géire. On the other hand, loss of schwa in this position might be a motivation for the addition of the suffix -id in most of these forms in Manx (as in geyrid ‘sharpness’; the original formation seems to have been retained mainly in specialized senses, so kiuney ‘a calm’ (at sea), kiunid ‘calmness’). We cannot therefore be sure whether Manx geir etc. represent géar (Sc. geur) or géire; if the former, it is quite possible that it became feminine under the influence of the general Manx tendency to make abstract nouns feminine (cf. nouns in -ys) and/or by analogy with semantically similar items pian, guin.”"

"And if we believe, that it is the Office of the Holy Ghost, to sanctify us and all the elect People of God ; then ought we to pray to God for his Holy Spirit, and we must comply with his good Motions, and submit to his working upon our Souls, that he may sanctify us and make us holy, that so we may be living Members of Christ’s holy Catholick Church.","As my ta shin credjal, Dy nee oik y Spyrryd Noo, dy chasherickey shinyn as ooilley pobble reiht Yee ; eisht lhisagh shin Padjer y ghoaill gys Jee son e Spyrryd Casherick, as shegin dooin y Choyrle vie echey y ghoaill as gingillaghey gys e obbraghey er nyn anmeenyn, dy vod Eh shin y chasherickey, as shin y yannoo crauee, myr shen dy vod mad ve Oltyn bio jeh slaane Aglish casherick Chreest.",,41,30,

"This in many Places is highly extolled, and most strictly required of us, as the very Sum of our Duty ; insomuch that we are often said to be justified or pardoned on Account of our Faith, and to be saved by Faith ; and all this chiefly, as I suppose, because true Faith produces Obedience, and makes a Man become an humble and sincere Disciple of Jesus Christ, and so makes us fit for the Mercies of God in and through  our Blessed Saviour.","Da shoh ayns ymmodee boallyn ta moylley mooar er ny choyrt, as dy geyr er ny hirrey orrin, myr eer vullagh nyn gurrym ; ayns whooish as dy vel shin dy mennick er ny ghra dy ve er nyn seyrey veih peccah, ny er nyn pardooney er coontey nyn Gredjue, as dy ve er nyn sauail liorish Credjue : As shoh er-skyn ooilley, myr ta mee smooinaghtyn, er-yn-oyr dy vel Credjue firrinagh gymmyrkey magh biallys, as cur er dooinney cheet dy ve ny Schoyllar imlee as firrinagh da Yeesey Creest, as myr shen jannoo shin aarloo son Myghinyn Yee, ayns as trooid nyn Saualtagh bannit.",,42,31,

"And all that is to be done by us, I reckon is contained in the Ten Commandments, as they are explained to us, and urged upon us, both by the Prophets in the Old Testament, and by our Saviour and his Apostles in the New ; especially in our Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount, in the fifth, sixth, and seventh Chapters of St. Matthew’s Gospel.","As ooilley ny ta dy ve jeant liorin, ta mee coontey dy vel eh scruit ayns ny Jeih Annaghyn, myr ta bun er ny choyrt dooin orroo, as ad chionnit orrin dy ve er nyn leeideil lioroo, chammah liorish ny Phadeyryn ayns y Chen Chonaant, as liorish nyn Saualtagh as e Ostyllyn ayns y Chonaant Noa ; er-skyn ooilley ayns Sharmane nyn Saualtagh er y Clieau, ayns y qhueiggoo, y cheyoo, as y chiaghtoo Chabdilyn y Noo Mian.",,42,31,

"[30]next to them, I shall refer you only to that pious and most useful Book, The Whole Duty of Man.",,,73,52,[30] The Manx omits this and the following paragraph suggesting possible book purchases.
"And I heartily wish that every poor Family in the Kingdom was furnished with one of those Books, together with a Bible and Common-Prayer Book, which might all be purchased for much less than five Shillings : And therefore it is great Pity they should be any where wanting.",,,73,52,
"Though, alas !

By 1763, when FRC was published, not even the Gospels and Acts were yet available in Manx, though they were in readers’ hands some four months later."
"and then to bestow, at least, Bibles upon them, that the Knowledge of God and Religion may be promoted amongst them ; which would greatly make for the Good and Welfare both of Church and State.","as eisht, lurg ayrnyn ennagh jeh Goo casherick Yee ve er ny choyrt daue ’sy ghlaare oc hene, dy vod Tushtey dy Yee as dy Chredjue v’er ny choyrt er y hoshiaght ny mastey oc ; shoh yinnagh mooarane Mie as Foays y yannoo ayns Theay as Aglish.",,73,52,
"For though brain-sick Opinions, and false Principles, may make Men proud and headstrong, and troublesome to their Governors ; yet, solid Knowledge, and sincere Godliness, will make Men humble and meek, quiet and peaceable, obedient to Magistrates and Ministers, full of Charity to their Neighbours, and ready to every good Work.","Son ga dy vod Smooinaghtyn mee-cheeallagh, as Credjue molteragh, sleih y yannoo moyrnagh as creoi-wannallagh, as boiragh da nyn Reilltee ; ny-yeih nee Tushtey fondagh, as Craueeaght firrinagh, sleih y yannoo imlee as meen, feagh as sheeoil, biallagh da Fir-oik as Saggyrtyn, laane dy Ghiastylys da nyn Naboonyn, as arryltagh gys dy chooilley Obbyr vie.",,73,52,
"And I am sure an Encrease of this truly religious Temper would be one of the greatest Blessings that can be bestowed upon this Earth, and would settle Kingdoms, Towns and Families, in Peace and Concord, which almost every where are divided amongst themselves, as well as against one another.","As ta mee shickyr jeh dy ragh leid yn ymmyrkey firrinagh crauee shoh ny smoo er y hoshiaght, dy beagh eh annane jeh ny Bannaghtyn smoo oddagh ve giootit er y thalloo shoh wass, as yinnagh eh Reeriaghtyn, Baljyn as  Lughtyn-thie, y chummal ayns Shee as Cordail, ta faggys ayns dy chooilley ynnyd ec streeu ny mastey oc hene, cha mie as noï ry oï.",,73,52,
"And by such blessed Effects of true Religion, something of Heaven would be brought down upon Earth, and our Souls would be well fitted for Heaven, when we are called off from this Earth, into those happy Regions above, where there is nothing else but Peace and Holiness, and Love and Joy.","As liorish leid ny Messyn bannit shoh jeh Credjue firrinagh, veagh red ennagh jeh Niau er ny chur lesh neose er y thalloo, as veagh ny anmeenyn ain dy mie kiarit son Niau, tra vees mad er nyn eamagh veih’n Thalloo shoh wass gys ny Ardjyn bannit shen er yn Yrjey, raad nagh vel veg arragh agh Shee as Craueeaght, as Graih as Gerjagh.",,74,52,
"And may it please God to bless these plain and short Instructions for the enlightening any Mind with that Wisdom from above, which is thus pure and peaceable, then shall I obtain my Design, and have great Cause to be thankful.","As dy gooidsaave lesh Jee e Vannaght y choyrt er y choyrle aashagh as yiare shoh son dy hoilshaghey Aigney erbee lesh y Chreenaght shen veih’n Yrjey, ta myr shoh glen as sheeoil, eisht you-yms shen ny va mee kiarrail, as bee oyr vooar aym dy ve booisal.",,74,52,
