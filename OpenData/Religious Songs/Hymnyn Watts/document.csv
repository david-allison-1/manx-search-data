On high before his face.,Ny ainlyn sollys niau.,
3 Not angels that stand round the Lord,Dy ronsagh creenaght vooar y Chiarn,
Can search his secret will:,Ta tushtey ainlyn giare,
"But they perform his heav’nly word,","Agh gys e ghloyr t’ ad goaill arrane,",
And sing his praises still.,As geeck nyn ammys share.,
"4 Then let me join this holy train,","[6] Dy voylley marish flaunyssee,",

To hear an infant sing.,Y choontey red neu-feeu.,
"5 My heart resolves, my tongue obeys,","Eisht ver-yms booise da ’ennym Noo,",

"2 I have been there, and still would go;","Nee’ms goll my ver y Chiarn dou pooar,",
’Tis like a little Heav’n below:,Te ayrn jeh flaunys er yn ooir;,
Not all my pleasure and my play,"Fardail y theihll cha vod m’y hayrn,",
Shall tempt me to forget this day.,Veih ooashley eunyssagh y Chiarn.,
"3 O write upon my mem’ry, Lord,",Yeesey! lesh pooar yn Spyrryd Noo,
The text and doctrines of thy word;,Scrieu er my aigney slane dty Glıoo;,
"That I may break thy laws no more,","Nee cooney lhiam dy reayll dty leigh,",
But love thee better than before.,Dagh laa m’ y vishaghey ayns graih.,
"4 With thoughts of Christ, and things divine,",Lhig smooinaghtyn er Niau as Creest,
Fill up this foolish heart of mine;,"Lhieeney my chree as aigney neesht,",
"That, hoping pardon thro’ his blood,",Nieet ayns e uill dy vod v’aym shee,
I may lie down and wake with God.,Lhie sheese as girree marish Jee.,
