Rucking hay down in the meadow out towards Ashcroft there, all ripe sallies, you know, but they used to be putting the herring on the greesagh too to roast it. Always the men would be coming in from the field at night and they would get their porridge and a cup of tea afterwards and a herring done on the greesagh, that was on the fire, you know, but on the ashes",21.2,64.677347

AK,,"but the old people used to be, Billy it was a ... they were making a living with going to pull bent, out to the shaslagh there (Shaslagh, Bent, or Marram Grass) pulling the bent you know, and making it in sheaves and selling it for a penny a sheaf, and there was twelve bundles in what they call a stook of bent and it would be a shilling and men used to do that in the winter time, when time would be slack, for to thatch houses, going to Douglas up way, and going to Laxey and different places. Two shillings and four shillings for four dozen sheaves of bent. Yes, and you know you put your hand down like that, and then you put your other hand on top of that and you pulled up the stalk and when you would have so many stalks together you would double them and shake them like this to shake the sand out, then put them all straight. I’ve seen my uncle, old uncle doing that and selling it at a shilling a stook. I think it was a yard or a yard and a half the band that you were tying. They were two long stalks of bent and you knotted them, and tied the sheaf with that, and you pulled it.",92.71,195.27257

But he was telling about the thatching. Now, that old ... You’ll hardly get thatch houses now. Our old thatch house out there (on Ballagarrett Ayres) is some of the oldest. That’s a very, very old place, you know. Aren’t they waiting now to get a new roof on it, that’s the way it’s not thatched. But that’s - oh, I don’t know what age will that... There was two dwelling houses there one time and there was a school in a stable and old Danny Teare and Robbie Garrett, they went to school in the stable, she was an old Dame that kept it in.",195.65121,253.438162
