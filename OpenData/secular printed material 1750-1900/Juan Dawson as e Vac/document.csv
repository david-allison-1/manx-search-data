[3] Kialteenys—Kialteeyn—‘churches’
[4] hallan—hallaghyn—‘halls’
[5] Ooil Lampyn—Lampyn Ooill, or Lostanyn Ooill would be expected here.
[6] Mwyllen—Mwyllin—‘a mill’, but here used to mean ‘machine’.
[7] Booyrd niaghyn—Buird niaghyn
[8] as Mwyllen Whaale, jent as Prowit. Lesh yn Roie obbyeens Sostnee—as mwyllin whaaley, jeant as prowit lesh yn reih obbreeyn Sostnagh
[9] be—bee—‘will be’
[10] er a Cumnnal—er e chummal—retained
[11] yn obbyr, ny Theay—obbyr-y-theay—the public’s work
[12] nagh gyn fageill—nagh jean fajeill—‘that will not fail’. FAJEIL, v. failing. This word is used by some instead of Failleil, but I cannot say it is correct, as it is not once used in the Scriptures, to my knowledge. (Cregeen)
[13] yeearree ny Thear—yeearree yn theay"
