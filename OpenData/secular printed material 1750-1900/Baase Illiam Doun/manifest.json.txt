A
MANKS [image—Three Legs Emblem with QUOCUNQUE JECARIS STABIT beneath] ELEGY
ON THE
MUCH LAMENTED
DEATH OF 
RECEIVER-GENERAL CHRISTIAN
OF RANALDSWAY
Who (for giving up the ISLE to the Usurper CROMWELL, then Master of the Three Kingdoms, and irresisitble) was cruelly and unjustly put to Death, (January, 1662) by a Tyrannical and wicked Faction in the ISLE;— Some of whose Descendants, are at this Time, endeavouring to destroy the Constitution of the Country, and introduce Vassalage and Slavery. — It is therefore thought expedient to republish this ingenious Performance — to open the Eyes of a deluded People.
