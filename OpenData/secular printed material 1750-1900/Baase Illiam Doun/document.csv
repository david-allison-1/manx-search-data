"Gow gys y Vannyster ny Callaghyn-Doo,","Go to the Monastry, the Black Crones,[8]",[8] Gow gys y Vannyster ny Callaghyn-Doo] Other translations assume the initial article to be superfluous and give ‘Go to the Nunnery of the Black-robed nuns’. The Calcot family acquired the Nunnery in 1536 when it was dissolved and Robert Colcot (Colcad) married the Prioress.

"Son Bleeantyn ny Vartar, va ROBIN ny lhie,","For years a cripple, Robin[9] was bedbound,","[9] Robin] likely to be Robert Colcot (Colcad) (died 1670), Captain of Douglas Fort who was one of the men who sat in judgement at Wiliam Christian’s trial. This Robert Colcot was great grandson of the Robert Colcot who aquired the Nunnery, and also owned the Scarlett (Scarleod) estate. The feud between the Christians and Colcots seems to have begun in 1643, when James Stanley tried to impose a three-generational term-limit on land leases. Deemster Ewan Christian (father of William), ruled that the Manx tenantry had de facto tenure of their land and rejected Stanley’s terms. Colcot sided with Stanley and took a three-generational lease on his land. To avoid forfeiture, Ewan Christian bequeathed his estate to his youngest son William Christian in 1655. This dispute sets the stage for the 1651 rebellion against the Stanleys, and William Christian’s execution."

Both Colcot and Stevenson sat in judgment at the trial of William Christian. "

Scarlett House was later owned by the Christian family."
