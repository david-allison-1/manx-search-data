","Dear Friend,—As several of us were returning together from the class meeting the other afternoon, we entered the house of one of the brethren to get a drink of water, and we got into a lengthy conversation about the janglings (dischord) among the Methodists. ",
,,
"      Fy yerrey hoal, ghow shin ayns laue dy phrowal ruleyn Wesley row ad cordail rish ny Scriptyryn Casherick, as dy chormal, chammah as oddagh shin, ymmyrkey-bea ny Methodeeyn rish ny ruleyn cheddin, er-çhee dy gheddyn magh cre va bun yn olk. ","     After some time spent, we undertook to examine the rules of Wesley, to see were they according to the Holy Scriptures, and to match up (compare) them, as well as we could, the manner of life the Mehodists at present lead with the same rules, in order out what was the root of the mischief. ",
"     Va fys mie dy liooar ain dy dreill ny chied Vethodeeyn ny ruleyn ayns yn aght t’ad screeut, myr ren shin hene keayrt dy row, (son cha nee oltyn aegey va veg jin,) agh va shin er n’ghoaill baght rish bleeantyn dy hraa, abbyr daeed blein ny erskyn, dy row’n ymmodee mooar er chooyl-skyrraghtyn veih’n çheshaght ain liorish cur raad da","     We knew full well that the first Methodists kept those rules, in the manner in which they are written, as we ourselves did once in the past, because none of us were were young members, but we had observed that for some years, say forty years or upwards, that a great many had backslidin (fallen away) from our company, by giving way to pride, gratifying the flesh in unnecessary things, gathering up earthly riches, brother going to law with brother, &c. ",
"moyrn, lhiggey lesh yn eill ayns nheeghyn gyn feme, çhaglym seose berçhys er y thalloo, braar goll gys y leigh rish braar, &c. ",,

Agh erskyn ooilley, hayrn shin gys cooinaghtyn dy row shin dy mennick er nyn oltooaney liorish cloan y theihll—as cha row eddin ain dy obbal ad—dy row ny reiltee, ny fir-oik, as ny hard-gheiney ain kinjagh brishey ny saraghyn, as nagh nhimmey Wesleyan va veg share na sleih elley, mannagh row ny smessey. ","     And our conscience did condem us that we ourselves were guilty of the same fault. But above all, we drew to mind that we are often reviled by the children of this world, and we had not the face to deny the same, that our rulers, officials, and leading men were constantly breaking the rules, and that very few Wesleyans there were that were any better than other people, if not worse. ",
,,
"     Nish eer my va’n oltooan shoh, ayns ayrn, er-gerrey dy laue kiart, cha voddagh shinyn jannoo rish; son, cha b’lhoys da fer erbee jin oghsan y chur da veg jeh nyn mraaraghyn, red ren shin keayrt as keayrt, as er-lheh, son goaill bolgymyn dy yough. ","     Now, even if this rebuke is very near the truth, we could not help it; none of us dare reprove any of our brethren for what we have done ourselves, and especially from time to time for taking mouthfuls of  strong drink. ",
"     Yiarragh ad rish er y çhooyl, “C’red ta shen dhyt’s? T’ou uss as dty horçh jannoo foddey ro chreeney jiu hene! Ta’n shirveishagh ain gra, as ta shin hene toiggal, dy vel jough coyrt gennallys ’sy chree as aash gys yn aigney. Cre’n cree oddys v’ec dooinney ta fegooish bine dy yough?

Cha row Wesley agh dooinney, as ta deiney chiart cha creeney rish ’sy theihll foast.”","     They would directly reply “What is that to thee? Thou and thy sort make yourselves too wise! Our minister saith, and we know ourselves, that strong drink cheers our heart, and brings peace to our minds. And what condition can a man be in without strong drink? Drink and liquor are the good creatures of God, whilst they are taken with thankfulness by them that believe and know the truth; therefore hold thy tongue off us, and leave off people that are better than thyself. Wesley was but a man, and there are men just as wise as he in the world yet.” ",
"     My veagh veg rait roo mychione saynt, ny rour imnea dy haglym cooid heihltagh, cha gredjagh ad dy row assee ayn, liorish dy row Solomon er ghra, “Ta argid gansoor dy chooilley nhee.” ","     If anything were to be said them about covetousness, or too much anxiety to gather worldy goods, they wouldn’t believe there is harm in it, because Solomon had said “Money answers all things.”",
,,
"     Inshagh ad dooin neesht, dy row Abram, ayr ny credjuee, “feer verçhagh ayns maase, ayns argid, as ayns airh.” ","      They would tell us too, that Abraham, the father of the faithful, was “abundantly rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.”",
"     My yiarragh shin roo dyn ad dy hreishteil ayns berçhys neu-hickyr, agh ayns y Jee bio, chassagh ad nyn  ghib orrin, as cha neaishtagh ad rooin. S’firrinagh t’eh, “Tra ta’n berçhagh loayrt ta dy chooilley ghooinney ny host: as jeeagh cre erbee t’eh dy ghra, t’ad dy voylley eh gys ny bodjallyn: agh my ta’n boght fosley e veeal t’ad gra, ‘Quoi eh shoh?” ","      If we would say to them not to put their trust in riches that are uncertain, but in the living God, they would turn their gobs on us, and would not hear us. How true is the saying “When the richman speaketh every man is silent: and look, whatever he says is applauded as high as the clouds, but if the poorman opens his mouth they ask, ‘Who is he?’”     ",

Then, unless he repents, no further part will he have let him have no longer a place with us.","[1] ayns y clane—‘In total’, ‘in entirety’.

Faithfully speaking we reckon it the greatest foolishness to expect any spiritual good among us as long as we willfully join in company with those who hath little better than a fine slippery show of religion and natural gifts from the head and mouth; and who pretend to be so spiritual as to make us imagine that they would lay down their lives for the brethren; at the same time not one of them will deny himself of a savoury meal or a glass of strong drink, or take up his cross on account of his weak brethren, though they should fall and perish round about him. And we fully made up our minds to exhort all assemblies of Christians to do what they could to help the English Methodists to remove the stumbling block out of the way of the people, and that quick before any more of the flock be destroyed.

There are a few sober, righteous and godly men yet within as well as outside of the Conference, who will not behave like  lords over God’s heritage, and who do not make a god of their belly, nor worship the golden image—men lowly and wise, without injustice and without hypocrisy, who will strive to do all things rightly and in order. But, after all, what will people do, should it happen that the hand of violence should bear its sway? As well, if it is to be exactly like that, (a most adequate thing if it be), can’t people take secure care of their purses? And we are, unless we are very much mistaken, if we bring all things to right quite soon, and the “Englishman “of ours will be no longer looked on as a “Hireling.” ",
