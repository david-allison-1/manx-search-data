","That he was very pleased that the residents of Peel had taken a lead as the first folk to uphold their own mother tongue. He also proved from The Word of God, both the Old Testament and the New Testament that God’s Word, in the way it was put down so beautifully and so gloriously in our own language there wasn’t anything that would overcome it. He also proved, by writers such as Adam Clarke, and other wirters with him who understood the original languages by writers such as Adam Clarke and other folk with him who understood the original languages that its beauty was great so that no tribe should be lost in Israel. The chairman was also advising the youth there, who are ashamed of their own language, and criticising them because when he would a man would ask them anything in Manx it’s an English answer he would get, (yes,) ashamed of their own language. He also read letters written by John Thomas Clarke, Swansea. They were written in the mother tongue. They were full of wisdom and of great beauty.","[1] Lewin; ansh [yn nainsh] - a variant pronunciation of aght , cf. ansherbee  [ãː nʃə'biː] for aght erbee  and [aːʃ for aght  (Broderick 1984: 6).]"

The people were from every part of the country, gathered together, there was a day in Peel that won’t be soon forgotten. Almost all the town is revived, taking so much pleasure in the old language. Old and young through all the streets rejoice and great eachother with the words “Here’s a merry Christmas and a good new year and health to the chair. The High Bailiff himself has enjoyed promoting it as much as he can. A great deal is made of it throughout the town. We cannot give a greater honour to some some of the women there. They pronounced the old language with pleasure.”",
