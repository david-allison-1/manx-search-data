Manx,English,Notes
Pleadeilys eddyr daa Vanninagh dooie.,A talk between two native Manxmen.,
(Juan as Illiam meeiteil.),,
,(Juan and Illiam meeting),
,,
Juan.—T’ou çheet.,Juan.—You’re coming.,
"Illiam.—Ta, t’ou uss çheet neesht","Illiam.— Yes, you’re coming too.",
J.—Ta moghrey fihn ayn.,J.—It’s a fine morning.,
"I.—Ta shen ayn, agh ta traa mie rastagh harrish ain.","I.—That’s right, but a pretty rough time we’ve had.",
J.—Ta dy jarroo. Geayll oo jeh’n lhong va trait laa chaie mooie jeh Kione Yurby?,J.—Yes indeed. Did you hear of the ship that was beached the other day off Jurby Head?,
I.—Dy ve shickyr—nagh row eh ’sy phabyr?,I. To be sure—wasn’t it in the paper?,
J.—Cre’n pabyr t’ou uss goaill?,J.—What paper do you take?,
"I.—Ta ghaa ny three jin goaill yn Heral eddyr shin; as shimmey oor pleasal t’eh cur orrin ceau; t’eh cur shaghey yn traa, choud’s t’eh ginsh jeh ny reddyn ta goll.","I.— There are two or three of us taking the Herald between us, and it has caused us to spend many a pleasing hour, while it tells of the things that are going on.",
J.—Ta Juan Bouyr as mee hene goaill y Sun eddyr shin. Ta wite pleat jeant ayn er y gherrid shoh mychione y Chiare-as-Feed—wite çhengleyrys.,J.—Deaf Juan and myself take the Sun between us. There’s so much prattle done in it recently about the Keys—so much altercation.,
,,
I.—Hoh! Ommijys lah—jus rud dy lhieeney yn duillag.,I.— Oh! Nonsense lad—just a thing to fill the page.,
J.—Ta ny smoo na shen ayn. Vel oo toiggal ad?,J.—There’s more than that in it. Do you understand them?,
"I.—T’ad mie doillee lhiam ny cheayrtyn, foast strou hene dy vel mee lane vie.","I.—I find them pretty difficult sometimes, still I think I’m very good.",
"J.—Insh dou cre ta’n fockle liauyr shen meanal, ‘rebrezentashyn’. T’ad gusal mennick eh, agh cha vel y cheeall mychione cre t’eh meanal.","J.— Tell me what that long word means ‘rebrezentashyn’. They often use it, but not the sense about what it means.",
"I.—Cha s’ayd cre rebrezentashyn! T’ou dty voght glen ny-yeih, mannagh s’ayd cre rebrezentashyn. Jeeagh ’sy dicksinerry, ghooinney as yiow jeeragh eh. Vel dicksinerry ayd—foddee nagh vel—eeaseeym’s nane dhyt.","I.—You don’t know what rebrezentashyn is! You’re a pure wretch nevertheless, if you don’t know what rebrezentashyn is. Look in your dicksinerry, man, and find it right away. Do you have a dicksinerry—maybe not—I lend one to you.",
,,
"J.—Oh ta shenn unnane aym ny lhie er y latt ayns shen sthie, agh ta ny duillagyn eck faggys ooilley raipit assjee; agh yioym un ockle aynjee foast—nee un duillag shen.","J.—Oh, I have an old one lying on the rack inside in there, but its pages are nearly all ripped out of it, but I’ll find one word in it yet—one page will do that.",
"I.—Cre sheeu dhyt boirey? Inshym’s mee hene dhyt, ghooinney. Rebrezentashyn—ta shen fer shassoo ayns ynnyd fer elley. Ta’n Heral shassoo er dy lhisagh sleih jannoo leighyn dy phleasal ad hene, cha nee faagail da’n Kiare-as-Feed ad. As dy jarroo ta mish mee hene goaill toshiaght dy leaystey red beg bentyn daue. Nagh beagh eh foddey share dooin stroak ve ain ayns ny coonseilyn oc? Shen myr tadyr ayns Sostyn. Ta dagh skeerey cur stiagh dooinney ayns yn ynnyd oc: dooinney reiht lioroo hene. As nagh mie veagh eh dy voghe shin kied voish y Ree dy reih dooinney ayns y skeerey ain, fer veagh toiggal feme y skeerey, as myr shen veagh fondagh dy chiarail leighyn fondagh dooin?","I.—What worth to you is (what’s the point of) worrying. Rebrezentashyn—that is one standing in another one’s place. The Herald is insisting that people should make laws to please themselves, not leaving them to the Keys. And, indeed, I am myself beginning to somewhat waver in my opinion concerning them Would it not be far better for us to have a ‘stroak’ (vote) in their councils? That’s how they are in England. Each Parish puts a man in their place: a man chosen by themselves. And wouldn’t it be good if we were to get permission from the King to choose a man in our parish, one who would know what the parish needs, and so would be reliable for  planning effectual laws for us?",
"J.—Cha vel mee gobbal. Nish hene t’ad taggloo jeh gobbal kied da ny heirinnee ta shirrey cur pudaaseyn ass çheer; as ta fys mie ain ooilley er dy vel shoh red feer neu-chreeney; son cre’n phrice yiow nish er yn arroo? As cre’n aght nee yn tannys y mayl? Er son feme cha bee ayn: yiow main palçhey voish Nalbin, as shen ayns traa giare, lhig da gennid ve ayn ny dyn; agh ta fys ain er un red, bee curnaght voish ny çheernyn mooie lhieeney stiagh orrin, as freayll sheese price yn arroo myr boallagh eh, myr shen nagh bee çhionse edyr faagit dooin.","J.—I’m not denying. Right now they are talking of refusing permission for the farmers who looking to export potatoes; and we all know well that this is a very unwise thing; for what price will be got now for the corn? And how will the tennant make the rent? There’ll be no need for it: we’ll get plenty from Scotland, and that in a short time, whether there be a scarcity or not; but we know one thing, there will be wheat from outside countries piling (filling) in on us, and keeping up the price of corn as it used to be, so there won’t be a chance at all left for us.",
I.—Ta’n irrin ayd. C’raad yiow sleih argid ec y traa t’ayn dy eeck ny feeaghyn bleeaney oc? Agh bee eh ny share da ny leighderyn.,I.—You have the truth. Where will people get money at the moment to pay their annual fees? But it will be better for the lawyers.,
"J.—Wahll, wahll, cha vel shoh agh un red ny-yeih, agh shimmey red t’ayn.","J.— Well, well, this is only one thing anyway, but there are many things in it. ",
"I.—Shoh yn queshtan, vel eh lowal da’n Chiare-as-Feed jannoo leigh erbee fegooish consent y theay? Er-nonney lhig daue ve reiht liorish y theay, as eisht veagh dagh skeerey as çhionse echey son cairys; son oddagh ad eisht jannoo stiagh rish y dooinney mooar oc hene er dy chooilley oyr jeh egin foshlit ny feme erbee oddagh ve reaghit liorish leigh noa.","I.— This is the question, are the Keys allowed to make any law without the consent of the public? If not, let them be chosen by the public, and then each parish would have chance for justice; so they could then intercede with the great man themselves on every cause requiring help openly, or any need that could be sorted by a new law.",
"J.—Veagh shoh resoonagh, dy ghra yn chooid sloo jeh. Agh cre sheeu taggloo? Cha vowmayd nyn aigney! ","J.—This would be reasonable, to say the least of it. But what is the worth of talking? They won’t find our opinion!",
I.—Kys s’ayd’s son shen? Foddee dy now.,I.—How do you know for that? Maybe they will.,
,,
"J.—Beggan! Ta’n Kiare-as-Feed as sneih currit orroo, as t’ad gra dy vel ad corree, as dy vel paart jeu hene screeu ayns y Sun cha keoi as dy beagh ad dy feer baanrit.","J.—Hardly! The Keys are vexed, and they say that they are angry, and that some of them write in the Sun as mad as if they were truly raving.",
"I.—Cha voddym credjal shen—ta sins[1] smoo ayndoo na dy ghoaill olk rish y irriney, shickyr. Ta fys mie oc er nagh re noi oc hene myr deiney er-lheh ta’n chooish bentyn, agh daue myr king-leeidee yn theay, as shen-y-fa cha vel eh queshtan ta bentyn da resoon cadjin, chamoo t’eh madyr erbee dauesyn agh dys vondeish y çheer; çheu-mooie jeh shen, dy beagh ad currit ass oik mairagh veagh eh dys y vondeish oc hene, son haueagh eh cost daue cha nee beggan, goll dys Balley Chashtal myr whilleen goayr dys bwoaillee. Ec y chooid smessey veagh ad myr vadyr: as eer bentyn da nyn ooashley oddagh eh ve ny share, son oddagh ad, whilleen as ta feeu, ve reiht ass y noa. As lurg ooilley quoi s’fondagh veagh son y vissness na ad hene?","I.—I can’t believe that—there is more sense in them than to take offence at the truth, surely. They well know that it isn’t against them as men individually that this case is concerned, but for them as leading heads of the public, and therefore it isn’t a question that concerns ordinary discourse, neither is it any matter for them, but for for the benefit of the country; besides, if they were to be put out of office tomorrow it would be to their own advantage, because it would save them the, not insignificant, cost of going to Castletown like so many goats to the fold. At worst they would be as they were, and even concerning their high status they could be better off, for they could, as many as are worthy, be elected anew. And afterall, who would be most effectual for the business than themselves?",[1] sins—‘sense’.
"J.—Cha s’aym’s boy, agh hee main cre jir yn Heral tra hig eh. Ta mish coontey lane jeh’n Heral. Ta mee treeal goaill eh son y nah raiee. Eeasee oo dou eh, as eeasym’s y Sun dhyt’s. Bee pleat dewil goll son shiaghtinyn.","J.—I don’t know boy, but we’ll see what the Herald says when it comes. I think a lot of the Herald. I have a mind to take it for the next quarter. You’ll lend it to me, and I’ll lend the Sun to you. There’ll be a vicious contention going for weeks.",
,,
I.—Dyn dooyt cha vod ad ve feagh.,I.—No doubt they won’t be able to be calm. ,
J.—T’ou uss er çheu yn Heral.,J.—You’re on the side of the Herald.,
"I.—Ta mee goaill rish dy vel, as cha nee fegooish resoon. Ta ooilley yn sleih son echey. Eie stiagh myr t’ou goll shaghey, as jeeaghym’s dhyt eh.","I.—I admit I am, and not without reason. All the people are in favour of it. Call in as you go past, and I’ll show it to you.",
,,
"J.—Feer vie, my vees traa aym nee’m gyllagh er y raad back.","J.—Very good, if I have time I’ll call on my way back.",
