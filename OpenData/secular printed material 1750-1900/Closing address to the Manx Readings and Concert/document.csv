It has been said that some Manx people are ashamed of language of their own country, but they should be proud of it, instead of being ashamed – what would we say, if the English were to be ashamed of English, and the French of the French language? It must be very joyous for the these men who have come so far to get this meeting up that so many have come to listen to them, and they’ll come home with good cheer, that their work isn’t in vain, in striving to revive the old language; the mother tongue of the Isle of Man."
