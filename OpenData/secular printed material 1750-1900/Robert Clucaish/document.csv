He will offer wonderful bargains in every kind of clothing-material for cash.","[1] Jemeh Four—this appears to be a mistranscription of Jerrey Fouyr—‘Harvest End’ / ‘October’. 
[2] jeh-lane—perhaps Jelhein—‘Monday’?
[3] yn vaugle—perhaps ‘the mangle’, but ‘mangleyn’—‘mangles’ would be expected. During the 1870s a combined washing & mangling machine called ‘The Vowel’ was popular in the IoM, unless this word refers to a particular type of cloth or clothing."
"To parties who may not understand this, a full explanation can be had at Clucas’s Great Sales, Douglas and Ramsey. ",,
