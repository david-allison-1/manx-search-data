"TA mee girree dy chur cheb da’n Thie shoh ta mee smooniaghtyn nagh jen peccagh erbee t’own loayrt n’oai. “Ta shen, dy bee’n Consideration sudjey jeh’n Bill shoh liggit shaghey dys three meeaghyn y laa jiu.”","I RISE to offer a Motion to the House which I imagine will meet with no Opposition. I move, “That the further Consideration of this Bill be deferred to this Day three Months.”"
,
"Agh houd as ta mee choyrt yn Chebb shoh, er lhiam dy vell eh Currym ta mee liastyn da’n Duke jeh Atholl as dy my Chooinscience hene, dy hoiaghey kiongort riu, ec y tra kieddin, yn oyr son y chebb shoh, as cre ta my smooniaghtyn hene, mykione shen ta ghoit stiagh ayns y Vill.","But while I make this Motion, I think it a Duty which I owe to the DUKE of ATHOLL and to my own Feelings, to state at the same Time the Reason on which this Motion is founded, and what are my Sentiments with Respect to the Object of the Bill itself."
"     Yn Oyr son choyrt y Cheb shoh ta mee submittal dys y Thie shoh, t’eh veih’n tastey shen ta mee ghoaill jeh ny Smooinaghtyn neu-foayroil ta ymodee jeh’n thie shoh er ghoaill my kione y Bill. Ta me smooniaghtyn dy beagh eh neu-vondeishagh da Carjeein y Duke jeh Atholl dy choyrt eh er y hoshiaght ayns y Staid te nish ayn. Cre thiell yn aght ta’d er ghoaill yn Smooniaghtyn shoh mychione y Bill ayns aght Briaght ny yei te feer cronnail dooise, ayns aght ny aght ynagh dy neighn da ve currit lesh er y hoshiagh reesht, dy vod feisht firrinagh as Brewnys cairal ve jent mychion ny aseeyn shen, jeh ta’n Duke jeh Atholl gaccan.","     My Reason for offering the Motion which I have submitted to the House is, that from observing the unfavourable Impressions of the Measures which have taken Place in the Minds of so many of the Members of the House. I think it would be unadvisable for the Friends of the Duke of Atholl to push it farther in its present Form. While, however these Impressions have been taken of the Measure in the Form of an Enquiry, I am at the same Time clearly of Opinion, that in some shape or other it must again be brought forward for Discussion, in order that a full Investigation of our Decision may be made with Regard to the Hardships of which the DUKE of ATHOLL complains."
"     Shen ta’n Duke jeh Atholl dy hirrey ayns y Vill shoh, t’eh reing eh hene ayns daa arn. Ta’n kied arn COOILLEENEY SMOO; as ta’n naa arn dy vod Cairyssyn inagh ve er ny choyrt da reesht, va goit voish liorish shen va jent ayns y vlein 1765 as nagh rou kiarit dy ve ghoit voish liorish yn Act kieddin","     The object of the Duke of Atholl in the present Bill, divides itself into two Points. The first of these Points is ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION: and the second is, That some Rights, of which he has been unintentionally deprived by the Transaction of 1765, may be restored."
"     My chione y Cooilleeney smoo, ta mee ghoaill rish nagh vod eh liorish y lhome Leigh shoh y hirrey er yn Parliament; as er y faa shen, roish my veagh Coilleeney smoo erbee giollot, ta me gearreee dy beagh y Neu-chorrymid cronnil eddyr y Phrice va eekit as y Vondeish va feddinit liorish y Ree dy foundagh er ny phrowal. Agh my ta’n Neu-chorrymid cronnail shoh dy foundagh er ny phrowal dy cooilleeney my Agney, er lhiam son shickerys ga nagh vod eh veg y hirrey liorish y lhome leigh, ny yei dy beagh Claimyn cairal as poorail ec y Duke jeh Atholl er Mieys as Foeiltys y theea.","     With Respect to the additional Compensation, I am ready to admit that to this he cannot have a legal Demand on the Strict Justice of Parliament; and therefore before any additional Compensation was granted, I should require that a clear, obvious, and flagrant Inadequacy be proved between the Price that was paid, and the Value that was acquired by the Crown. But if this is clear, obvious, and flagrant Inadequacy is proved to my Conviction, I would certainly hold, that though there was no legal Demand in Point of Strict Justice, yet that the DUKE of ATHOLL would have just and powerful Claims on the Monifience and Liberality of the Public."
"     Mychione ny Cairyssyn shen ayns y Vill myr callit liorish yn Act shen hug yn Ellan dy Vannin back reesht dys Ree Saxton, te’n Smooniaghtyn ayms, veih ooilley ny ta me er ackin er y Chooish, dy vel yn Duke jeh Atholl er choal ymodee Cairyssin liorish yn Act shen nagh rou’n Parliament kiarail dy ghoaill veih. Ny cairyssin shoh ta’n Parliament, son shockerys kainlt ayns cairis dy Explainal as dy confirmal.","     With Respect to those Rights which are closed in the Bill as lost by the accidental Effect of the Act which revested the Isle of Mann in the Crown of Great Britain, I am, from all that I have seen of the Subject , decidedly of Opinion, that the DUKE of ATHOLL has been deprived of various Rights which it was not in the Contemplation of Parliament by that Act to assume. These Rights; Parliament are certainly bound in Justice to have explained and confirmed."
"     Mastey ny ymodee Smooniaghtyn neu-foiroil mychione yn arn shoh jeh’n Bill, ta shoh dy menic er ve loarit jeh: — Dy beagh ny Cairyssyn shoh currit back reesht da’n Duke jeh Atholl, dy beagh eh feer nieu-vondeishagh de Cheer Vannyn. Dy beagh eh shoh son firrinys yn Cooish, cha jen yns dy bragh consental (ga dy beagh ny Cairyssin shoh eer er ny phrowal ayns firrinys dy ve bentyn da’n Duke jeh Atholl,) dy beagh ad currit back da reesht. Son cha fagys as ta Ellan Vanin ayns Cairjys rish yn Cheer shoh, as fo yn Reialltys shoh, ta cairys ec, as lissagh ee medeil, (chama as dagh arn elley jeh Reereeagh Saxton,) Foar as Coadey. Ec y tra kiedin veign booiagh ve er my hoigal, dy vel mee foadey veih smooniaghtyn, ny gra, dy vel Cairys erbee ta’n Duke jeh Atholl claimal noai Maynrys Cheer Vannin. Shoh ynrican ta mee shasoo er, nagh lissagh Cairyssyn erbee ta jannoo asee da’n theea, ve er ny choyrt back da’n persoon er lieh; agh ny yie my ta’d Cairyssyn ta ayns firrinys bentyn da’n Duke jeh Atholl , as ymyrtsagh dy ve freelt son Vondeish y Cheer shoh, cha lissagh ad ve freilt fagooish Cooilleeney cooie ve er ny choyrt da’n Persoon veih ta’d er ny ghoaill. Laane ta er ve rait, myrghedin mychione y Vaynrys ta Ellan Vannin er farjaghyn jeh fo coadey Rheilltys Saxton; agh my hig eh kione-fackin dy vell laane jeh’n Vaynrys shoh cheet veih freeal Possession jeh Cairyssyn va bentyn da’n Duke jeh Atholl, nagh bee shoh Oyr fondagh dy loayrt ny smoo ny lurg shoh jeh ny Claimyn echey, as da’n Parliament dy yannoo liassaghey da son ny the er choall?","     Among the unfavourable Imressions taken up with Regard to this Point of the Bill, this has been often insisted on:— That the Restoration of these Rights to the DUKE of ATHOLL, would prove injurious to the Prosperity of the life of Mann. I would  certainly never consent that ever, though these Rights were even proven in Justice to belong to the DUKE of ATHOLL, they should be again restored. For connected as the Isle of Mann is with this Country, and subject to this Legislature, it is entitled to, and ought to meet (equally with every other Part of the British Dominions,) Protection and Encouragement. At the same Time I wish it to be understood, that I am far from thinking, or saying, that any Rights claimed by the DUKE of ATHOLL are inconsistent with the Prosperity of the Isle of Mann. I mean only to say that no Rights injurious to the Public, should revert to the Individual; but still, if they are Rights really belonging to the DUKE of ATHOLL, and necessary to be retained for Advantage of theis Country, they should not be retained without a proper Compensation being made to the Individual from whom they are taken. Much has also been said of the Prosperity which the Isle of Mann has experienced under the Protection of the Government, but if it appear that much of this Prosperity has arisen from the Possession of Rights which belonged to the DUKE of ATHLL, will not this afford an additional Argument for future Discussion of his Claims, and for the Interference of Parliament to redress the Injuries he has suffered?"

"     Ec y tra shoh ta mee shaghyney gholl veg sudjey ayns y Cooish shoh; Smoonee me eh ymirtsagh er y faa shen, ayns Cairys da’n Duke jeh Atholl, as da my Choonsciance hene, dy hoiaghey kiongoyrt riu my Smooniaghtyn ayns yn aght shoh. Fegooish buirey ’n thie veg sudjey er y fa shen ta mee reesht chebbal diu “dy jin y thie pointeil Committee jeh’n thie er y Bill shoh three meeaghyn y La jiu.” ","    At this Time I avoid entering more fully into the Business; I thought it however necessary, in Justice to the DUKE of ATHOLL, and to my own Feelings, to state in this Manner what were my Sentiments. Without troubling therefore the House further, I only repeat my Motion “That the House resolve itself into a Committee on this Bill upon this Day three months."
