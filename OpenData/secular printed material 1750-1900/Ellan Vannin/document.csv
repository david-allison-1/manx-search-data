Manx,English,Notes
When the summer day is over,"Tra ta’n laa yn touree ceaut aym, ",
"And its busy cares have flown,","As e gheinys immit ta, ",
I sit beneath the starlight,"Ta mee soie fo ny rollageyn, ",
"With a weary heart, alone,","Lesh cree trome aym, goaill my ea. ",
"Then rises like a vision,","Shee ee myr ny scadoo girree, ",
"Sparkling bright in nature’s glee,","Elian Vannin veen lhiam pene, ",
My own dear Ellan Vannin,"Marish reaid dy ghooghys urree, ",
With its green hills by the sea.,As croink glassey rish y cheayn.,
Then I hear the wavelets murmur,"Paagey traie ny mooinjer-veggey, ",
"As they kiss the fairy shore,","Ta ny tonnyn coyrt thassane, ",
Then beneath the em'rald waters,"Fo yn ushtey dowin as geayney, ",
"Sings the mermaid as of yore,",Ta’n ven-varrey goaill arrane. ,
And the fair Isle shines with beauty,"Ta’n ellan soilshean ayns aalid, ",
"As in youth it dawned on me,","Elian Vannin veg lhiam-pene, ",
My own dear Ellan Vannin,"Myr v’ee soilshean ayns my aegid, ",
With its green hills by the sea.,Lesh croink glassey rish y cheayn.,
Then mem’ries sweet and tender,"Eisht ta cooinaght meigh as millish,",
"Come like music's plaintive flow,","Cheet rhyms myr yn chiaulleeaght, ",
Of the hearts in Ellan Vannin,"Jeh ny creeaghyn ayns Mannin, ",
"That lov’d me long ago,","V’adsyn orrym’s fear graihagh, ",
"And I give with tears and blessings,",Marish jeir as bannaght ta mee ,
"My own fondest thoughts to thee,",Coyrt smooinaght ennoil as beayn ,
My own dear Ellan Vannin,"Er my Vannin villish ghraihoil, ",
With its green hills by the sea.,Lesh croink glassey rish y cheayn. ,
