However such a door-to-door collection did take place - there is a note of it in the Parish Register of Jurby. The Manx Museum also hold a manuscript — MS 224a, a contemporary translation into Manx by William Clucas, vicar of Malew.’ The Manx manuscript is a close translation of the English with numerous corrections in the hand of the writer. It contains one extra letter, presumably also a translation, from Lieutenant Governor Dawson to the Clergy. Although it is clear that Clucas brought the letters to the attention of Lieutenant Governor Dawson, it is not certain that the translations are also his work, but on the balance of probablities are credited here as so. The final letter (from Richard Dawson) is not included with the printed pamphlet, the translation for that letter was done in 2023",
