Manx,English,Notes
YN ARRANE-CAGGEE-ANMORMONAGH.[1],THE ANTI-MORMON WARSONG,"[1] The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, also known as the Mormons, was established in the state of New York in 1830. The first Mormon mission to the Isle of Man took place in 1840. Converts were encouraged to emigrate to Mormon settlements in Missouri, and later Utah. As full immersion baptism is a Mormon ritual they were called ‘dippers’, a nickname also given to Baptists."
