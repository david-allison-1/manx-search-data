THE CROW AND THE PITCHER,YN FANNAG AS YN CRUISHTIN.
     There was a crow ready to die with thirst. She flew to a pitcher which she saw at a distance from her. ,"     Va fannag dy row, aarloo dy gheddyn baase son paays, detyl ee gys saagh-ushtey honnick ee tammylt roïe. "
"When she came she found water in it indeed, bnt so near the bottom that she could not reach it with all her stooping and stretching.","Tra haink ee hooar ee ushtey ayn dy jarroo, agh cha faggys da’n thoin nagh voddagh ee y roshtyn lesh ooilley yn croymmey eck as sheeyney."
     Then she sought to throw the vessel over that she might at least get a little drop to drink.,"     Eisht hirr ee dy hilgey harrish yn saagh, dy voddagh ee ec y chooid sloo bine beg y gheddyn."
But her strength was not enough for this. ,Agh cha row e niart dy liooar son shoh. 
At last she saw some pebbles near at hand.,Ec y jerrey ren ee claghyn-cruinn y akin er-gerrey dy laue.
"She cast them one by one into the vessel, until little by little the water rose to the top of the pitcher, and she drank in plenty. ",Cheau ee ad nane lurg nane stiagh ayns y saagh er derrey as ny veggan as ny veggan dirree yn ushtey dys mullagh yn  chruishtin as diu ee dy palchey.

MORAL.,BUNKEEAYL. 
     Many a thing that cannot be done by strength or by the common method may be brought about by new and unaccustomed means.,"     Shimmey red nagh vod ve jeant lesh niart, ny liorish yn aght cadjin oddys ve currit lesh mygeayrt liorish saaseyn noa as neu-oayllagh."
