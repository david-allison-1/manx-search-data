A FABLE (FROM ÆSOP) IN MANX. The following fable in Manx appeared in a scarce little book published 1863, entitled “The Manx Fable Book and Keepsake, by W. F. Peacock. Irish and Welsh versions are also given. There is also a Manx translation of Heber’s beautiful hymn “Thou art gone to the grave,” together with some conversational sentences in the same - three languages. The name of the translator is not given, but it was probably Mr J. Ivon Mosley (the compiler of a Manx dictionary), who was a friend of the author of the book. It may interest readers of your Manx Language column.
