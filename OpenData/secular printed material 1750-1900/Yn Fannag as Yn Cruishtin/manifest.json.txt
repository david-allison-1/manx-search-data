Articles or notes forwarded must be brief.]\r\nA FABLE (FROM \u00C6SOP) IN MANX. The following fable in Manx appeared in a scarce little book published 1863, entitled \u201CThe Manx Fable Book and Keepsake, by W. F. Peacock. Irish and Welsh versions are also given. There is also a Manx translation of Heber\u2019s beautiful hymn \u201CThou art gone to the grave,\u201D together with some conversational sentences in the same - three languages. The name of the translator is not given, but it was probably Mr J. Ivon Mosley (the compiler of a Manx dictionary), who was a friend of the author of the book. It may interest readers of your Manx Language column.\r\nStreatham. G. W. WOOD.",
