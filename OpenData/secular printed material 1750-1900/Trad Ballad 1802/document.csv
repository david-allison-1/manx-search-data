As dy ving lhieu ayns my Chant:,"And if in my chant you find it sounds good,",
"Myr share dy voddyms lesh my Veeall,","(Then) as best I can with my mouth,",
Yinnin diu geill da’n Ellan Sheeant., I would give you notice of the Blessed Isle.,
"Quoi yn chied er ec row rieau ee,","Who the first one was who ever had it,",
Ny kys eisht myr haghyr da;,Or how thence it turned out;,
"Ny kys hug Parick ayn Creestee,","Or how Patrick installed a Christian,",
Ny kys myr haink ee gys Stanlaa.,Or how as it came to Stanley.,
"Mananan beg va Mac y Leirr,","Little Mannanan was the Son of the Leirr,",
Shen yn chied er ec row rieau ee;,That was the first one who ever had her;,
"Agh myr share oddym’s cur-my-ner,","But as best I can observe,",

"As shen myr dreill Mananan keoie,","And that is how wild Mananan,",
Yn Ellan shoh’n-ayn lesh cosney Bwoid.[4],kept this Island by winning victory.,"[4] Bwoid—neither of the usual definintions for bwoid—‘handsomeness’, or ‘penis’, are suitable translations here. Bwoid seems rather to mean ‘victory’, (Old Irish; búaid) and therefore be cognate with Scottish Gaelic buaidh—‘success, conquest, victory, consequence, effect, impact, influence, sway, mastery, predominance’ (Dwelly). The spelling booydje in ‘Manninyn Beg va Mac yn Lear’ (Mona's Herald, Saturday, July 23, 1836) supports this view. The use of the word here, in a pamphlet almost certainly designed as veiled criticism of the Duke of Atholl’s avaracious view of taxation, suggests it was current at the time of publication."
"Yn Mayll deeck dagh unnane ass e Cheer,","The rent that each individual paid from his land,",
Va bart dy Leaogher-ghlass dagh blein;,Was a bundle of green bull-rushes every year;,

Ec Mananan erskyn Keamool.[5],"At Mananan, above Keamool.","[5] Keamool] there is no satisfactory explaination of where or what Keamool is or was. In ‘Manninyn Beg va Mac yn Lear’ (Mona's Herald, Saturday, July 23, 1836) the spelling given is; Kemmooyl."

Goill used in Old Irish for foreigners generally, and in Scottish Gaelic for non-Gaelic speaking Scots and the South of Scotland generally.

"Cha vel mee geearree Mie ny Maase,[26]","I am not desiring prosperity or goods,","[26] Maase] usually ‘livestock’.
