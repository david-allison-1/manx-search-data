"Ta ny raaghyn creeney shoh jeh pobble China, ta shin ec y traa shoh ayns caggey roo, jeeaghyn nagh vel ad sleih cha giare-cheeallagh as ta shin cliaghtey jeeaghyn orroo ve.","These proverbs from the people of China, that we are in a war with, show that they aren’t as stupid as we are accustomed to look upon them to be."
,
"1.—Ta’n red ta shin feme, mennick freayll ayns nyn laue shen ny t’ain.","1.—A thing that we need, often keeps in our hands that which we have."
"2.—Mannagh vel caslys jeh sterrym, fenee daa cheayrt jeed hene, caid arrys y kiunid shoh?","2.—If there is sign of a storm, ask yourself twice, how long will this calmness last."
"3.—Ghoghe dooinney rish lane foays ve echey hene, roish yinnagh eh beaghey ny mast’ocsyn, ta lesh cooid y veggan jeh.",3.—A man would admit to having a lot of goodness before he would live amongst those who have hardly any.
"4.—Cha vel fer ayns jeih thousaneyn feddyn baase voish pyshoon, as foast ta dy chooilley wan ayns aggle roish: ta ny thousaneyn feddyn baase voish laanid beaghey, neu-heeltys, as beggan lheill, as ny-yeih cha nhimmey peiagh ta ayns aggle roish ny huilk shen.","4.—There isn’t a man in ten thousand who dies from poison, and yet everyone is afraid of it; there are thousands who die from a plentitude of food, insobriety, and lack of exercise, and yet there aren’t many people who are afraid of those evils."
"5.—Dy goghe oo ayns laue shiaulley harrish slyst ny marrey er bleddyr, cre cha imneagh as veagh oo dy endeil eh veih bred snaidey! Freill arrey er dty chree as dty ymmyrkey lesh yn imnea cheddin.","5.—If you were to undertake to sail over the sea-coast on a bladder, how anxious would you be to defend it from a needle-prick! Keep watch on your heart and your behaviour with the same anxiousness."
6.—Ta dyman lesh lheamys jeh feeuid smoo na ta clagh chadjin ta dyn cron. ,6.—A diamond with a blemish is of more value than a common stone without a mark. 
"     Ta raa creeney myrgeddin cadjin ny vud oc bentyn da ny saaseyn dy lheihys. Jir ad—dyn goaill ayns laue geebyrt ooilley ny drogh umuryn ass y chorp ec keayrt, er aggle dy bee ny umuryn mie er nyn vollaghey—er-nonney dy jean y martyr","     There is also a common proverb amongst them  concerning the methods of healing. They will say—not to try to expell all the bad humours from the body at once, for fear that the good humours will be hidden—otherwise the martyr weakens. It’s enough if a seven or eight tenths of the deadly toxin is overcome by medicine, in so much as his own nature will gradually do the rest. This proverb is most worthy in the ruling of kingdoms and governing households."
