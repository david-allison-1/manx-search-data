"Ny how eh, ny how eh[5] ","Don’t warn him, don’t warn him","[5] Ny how eh] unkown phrase. In this translation it is assumed to be a typo for [Ny row eh], a non-standard spelling of [Ny raaue eh] ‘Don’t warn him’ — although [raaue] is described as a verb by Cregeen, it is elsewhere found only as a noun. Alternative readings; [Ny low eh] ‘Don’t allow him’ (to go), [Ny tow eh] ‘Don’t tow him’. Whether any of these was the intended phrase is questionable."
