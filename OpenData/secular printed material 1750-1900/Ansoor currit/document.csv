For what purpose has the bill of rights been called out (quoted?) of late but to keep the contrived suits alive for no purpose, which if they were left to themselves, would wither and die without meddling, or consequence. “The liberties of the People”, and “undermining their Rights and Possessions”, these are the wonderful words that nutures such a sort of men to turn to demagogues[6], and to lead them forward to complete victory.","[1] billey—‘a bill’.

"     Yn Ree, as Parliament Hosthen, ny Briwnyn share ayns Aggyrtsyn y Duke orroo hene; as smoo shickyr theh, nagh jeanadsyn shirrey cooney ny coyrle, eg traa yn Settlement, er Kiare-as-feed Vannin.","     The King, and the Parliament of England, are the best judges of the demands of the Duke upon themselves, and it is most certain that they will not seek help or advice at the time of settlement, from the Keys of Mann.",

However, this is the case; that the Bills that were previously submitted, and also this latest Bill, were withdrawn at the request of the Duke himself, and this, without negating his claims in the thinking of any upstanding reasonable man; but rather that the request of his demand was grounded on Propriety and Justice; and, therefore, for complete Settlement of the case was submitted again to the judgement of the Parliament.",

This, more than once, has been accepted by the Parliament of England; but these rights do not in any way thwart the rights of the people. The Act of Settlement, passed in 1703, had already given a full decision in the matters that were between the Duke and his tenantry; and the Letter of the Duke to his Commissioners ought to have conferred upon every man of Upright Character a clear view, that the Duke did not have the slightest intention of infringing the said Act. It is enough for the Keys to have taken up the matter, when they had discovered that the basis of the Act of Settlement was openly and knowingly undermined; and when they perceived that there were signs of danger at hand, that it would not have been fair in them to have let the people know what danger they were in, and to have been asked what their opinions were, and what advice they would offer them, before they would proceed in the matter; and above all before they took it upon themselves to expend any money, for (what they called) The Public’s Case; but which the public did not know about, except by sly comment.

It is with the Realm of England that the previous Duke, and the Dowager Duchess of Athol, who is still alive, bargained for the surrender of the Government of the Island, and it is from the Government and Parliament of England, (the parties who have benefited by the surrender) that the current Duke looks for fair recompense, appropriate for his status, governance, and taxes, that his ancestors surrendered for the benefit of England; and it is not to be thought, as you would complain, that an agreeable Chief Servant of a great and generous Nation would propose to Parliament, not only to receive recompense from the pockets of the inhabitants of Mann; but at the same time to remove the soldiers from the Island, and so to cut off the People from the gracious protection of the King. Such grumbling as this is slander against the King and against the Parliament of England; and it is an extreme audacity within you, man, to presume to instruct the Realm of England the method they will take to make the recompense that is due to the Duke of Atholl. No doubt you are that much of a Lawyer as to understand the danger of the ground you have occupied in this matter; and therefore you dare not do honour to your slanderous pamphlet by putting your own name to it.

How did these come to be taxed equal to quaterlands in the neighbourhoods of Castletown and Douglas, that are let, some of them together with a good surplus, for a hundred English pounds a year? Moreover, this Bill explains that, before the Island was surrendered to the King, the Duke of Atholl was obliged, as King and Lord of the Isle of Man, to keep up repair from his own income; all the Garrisons, Prisons, &c. If that is the matter, it is only natural to judge, now that the Crown of England is in possession of the government and taxes that previously belonged to the House of Athol, that the Government of England is bound to support the said garrisons and prisons at their own cost, and therefore, that an application ought to be made to the Parliament of England to allow a sufficient sum for satisfying every necessary purpose that concerns the Government, without putting any taxes at all on the inhabitants of the Island, who it is well known are not capable of paying them. I am, therefore, putting  it to you yourself to judge who is the true Friend of the Inhabitants of Mann; the Duke of Athol, who does his part to keep them from being taxed, or a faction of the Keys, who strive with the utmost of their powers, to oppress them by burdening them with unnecessary tax?

I answer, that no creep such as you can in any way taste the Noble thoughts of his Heart. The people of Mann are his tenantry; and it is the earnest desire of his heart to see them flourish, and to encourage them in their agriculture, fishing, dealing and industry. He has insisted on defending his own property, as well as Industry. He has insisted on  defending his own property, as well as the property of every man in the Island, from tyranny; and he is ready to meet the Defenders of the Bill of Assessment beside his Council in the presence of the King and his Council.","[12] Doortiman, Dooyrtiman,—s. pl. yn. ‘a proverb’, ‘a cant expression’, ‘witticism’, ‘an adage’, ‘an old saying’, ‘a hearsay’.

","     According to the ancient laws and customs of Mann, when a new law was to be made, the lord, or the Governor in his name, called the public and church officers, as well as the Keys, to meet him in Council; and he ordered four men to be chosen from every parish, to consider and to advise what laws were suitable to be made for the peace and security of the Island. This shows that it was the old law and custom of Mann had been at every time in accord with the rights that pertain to mankind; that the Clergy (the Priests) had a share in making laws, as did the Bishop and his ecclesiastical judges on their behalf in the council; and by means of the four men who were beneath them from every parish, the whole public had knowledge of it, and they gave their consent to the law by which they were to be ruled. Is this what has been the case in the Bill of Assessment? No, most certainly not. Were the Bishop or his ecclesiastical-Judges called to tell their thoughts, and to give their consent to a Law by which means they were to be taxed? No. Were the four men from every parish called to give their advice and opinion in the same way? No. What then, was the case? Why, the twenty-four men who were to select themselves, and only a faction of the Council met the governor in Tynwald Court and they made a law for giving such and such of those taxes on the holdings of the entire people, of whom the Bill of Assessment gives accurate assistance.",

But to put the matter beyond all manner of doubt, the Public need not but simply read the Letter of the Duke of Athol, to his Commissioners in Mann.

The other gentlemen named in the Commission are the Bishop, and Captain Taubman; the last of these who, up until he gave up his office very recently, managed the receipt and expenditure for the Duke of his rents &c. So Deemster Moore did not sit in the Duke of Athol’s courts, except as a judge; an office to which his Grace has a right, as does the Bishop as a Baron, to call upon him, for maintaining their courts, courts that have always been kept in the presence of a judge, and for which the law gives to the judge the court’s capacity. There is a clerk in the office of the Duke of Athol who is an attorney at the Manx Bar, and who does the work of the office under appointment of the commissioners.","[15] yarnaag— Cregeen; yarnaig— ‘a hank of yarn or thread’, seems here to mean ‘tangle’."

The Deemster is not alone, but many other Manx residents, were, by such as the kind as that of individuals, led astray by the baseless rumour that it was the intention of the Duke of Athol at that time, and only on that turn[17], that he signed and stood up in support of the Bill of Assessment; and I truly believe, if many of those who signed and were on the side of this Bill, showed themselves, and honourably explain the opinions of their hearts, it would become evident that the are now of the same opinion as Deemster Moore.","[16] dy mie, vennick lesh—Wheeler suspects this is a misprinted, or corrupted version of dy my vennick lesh—', i.e. with the past dependent of s’mennick lesh.

And as no Deemster was appointed for the Northside of Mann, Deemster Moore has had the greatest trouble in carrying out the duty of his office. For making proper recompense for this trouble, Governor Smith made a promise to get him an amendment to his income, something that he did not receive for eleven years, and to all appearances that would never have received, if the Duke of Athol had not noticed and paid attention to the hardship he was experiencing in fully contolling the affairs of the country, and that for the trivial income of a hundred pounds a year,---an income that is, indeed, very unequal to the high status of the King’s Chief Judge in the Isle of Man.",

Not even Mr Juan Cosnahan himself, who is one of them, and, as High Bailiff of Douglas a kind of judge, thought it improper or unbecoming to the high-status of his office to apply for this position; and although he is not so robust that one would say that there are enough in fees in it to bear a very heavy burden, nevertheless, I suspect that he wouldn’t perceive an ache in his own body, or a pain in his great office, or the complaining or jealousy of his heart, when he would be bearing on his back, from the office of the Duke of Athol to his own house in Douglas, two hundred pounds a year, neither do I believe that any one of those other gentlemen, who put in for the position, would refuse to take the burden off his shoulders, when they saw that he felt that his great status was bending under the load.","[19] trughanys, s. ‘envy’, ‘jealousy’; also, ‘murmuring’, ‘rebellion’.

That office was abolished before the Duke ever came to Mann, and the Salary of a hundred pounds a year that belonged to the said office (by the advice of Mr. Lutwidge, who is now dead) was added to the Salary of the Attorney who is now under the King. It is well known, Sir, that the affrontery you have taken to the good name of Deemster Moore springs from envy and spite.","[20] Doortiman, Dooyrtiman,—s. pl. yn. ‘a proverb’, ‘a cant expression’, ‘witticism’, ‘an adage’, ‘an old saying’, ‘a hearsay’.

It is a more amazing that this malicious rumour has not disappeared because of the words that the Duke of Athol said to Mr. Taubman two years ago, that is that “If the Inhabitants of Mann do not Consider themselves secure in their Rights and Holdings, according to the Act of Settlement of 1703, that he was prepared to go with them hand to hand, and request Parliament to act on it.” The answer Mr. Taubman gave to this good offer that the Duke made being, “that he wouldn’t give five pounds for such an Act because he was looking upon their Rights and Holdings as secure, without any doubt.” Seeing that this was the judgement of Mr. Taubman, who has the largest Holdings in the Island, if they are not in danger, in the Name of God, what need is there for all this calling and shouting, on account of Rights, Liberties, and the Possessions of the People? and especially when the Chief Officers of the King, have openly explained in Parliament that the Manx people, their Rights, their Liberties, and their Holdings, are under the protection of the Crown of England. It must come into the thoughts of every man who takes good note of what he sees and hears, that these malicious rumours and alarms are aroused and spread by such a kind of people as are trying to bring about those such aims as are best known to themselves, but unless I am mistaken in the matter, it is clearly perceived by the eye of the people.",
