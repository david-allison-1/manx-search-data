Manx,English,Notes
Bieau as y vodjal roish ny geayee,"Swift as the cloud before the wind,",
Ta blein[1] elley ’r sheeley roee;,"Another year has sneaked on her way,",[1] Blein—‘year’. The original spells throughout as bleain.
"      Blein elley cheet - yn vlein shen fo’ee,","     Another year coming - that year under her,",
Nagh vaik my hooill dy bra:,"My eye will never see,",
"Yn ghrian[2] shid cur lesh stiagh y blein[3],","Yonder sun bringing in the year,","[2] Yn ghrian— ‘The sun’. The noun grian is almost always considered feminine, as it is here (with lenition after the article in the nominative). Later in the verse the yn ghrian is treated as masculine; e ghoull ‘his beam’, e vreein ‘his heat’.
[3] y blein— ‘the year’. The noun blein is almost always considered feminine, so vlein would be expected after the article – as occurs in the third line.  "
"Roish nee e ghoull blein elley rhein,",Before her ray will rule another year,
"Ny mee y hiow lesh bioyr e vreein,",Or warm me with the vitality of her heat,
     Foddyms ve sheeyn fo’n scraa.,     I may be lying under the sod.,

"Lesh credjue, surranse, as lesh preayll,","With faith, patience and with prayer,",
"Dy yintyn[4] aynym slane treishteil,","To conceive within in me complete trust,","[4] dy yintyn— ‘to conceive’, ‘to generate’, standard spelling in the corpus is dy ghientyn (or the longer form; dy ghiennaghtyn). The current preference in Manx writing is to use yi to represent lenited gi, rather than ghi, and current writers would likely choose the spelling yientyn."
"     As aarlys son y baase[5],","     And readiness for death,","[5] y baase— ‘death’. Elsewhere in the corpus y vaase would be expected, and doubly so in this case as the article is preceded by a preposition."

"Ga dy bee’n corp sy joan ergooyl,","Although the body will be behind in the dust,",
"Nee m’annym beayn ayns soiljey[6] shooyl,","My eternal soul will be walk in the light,","[6] soiljey— ‘light’. Although the more common spelling soilshey is used in the Bible, other writers (particularly Ned Beg Hom Ruy in his own writing) prefer soiljey."

Nish ta blein elley’r skirrey chaie;,   Now another year has slid past;,
"Tappee myr strooan roï my-lheï[7],",Fast like a stream running downhill,"[7]  my-lheï— ‘downhill’ the original text gives mylheï. Elsewhere in the corpus my-lheï is found in the compound kione-my-lheï; ‘descent’, ‘downhill’, ‘headlong’, ‘prone’, ‘slope’, ‘steep’,  my-laee in kione-my-laee ‘the drooping, or lower end’, and my-lhiee in the the compund gour-my-lhiee ‘adown’, kione-my-lheïe ‘declavity’. Cregeen gives the spelling myla’ee; ‘with the descent, drooping’."
Ayns freayn guirroogh[8] byleshey roi,In its roaring flow running,"[8] guirroogh— Here taken to be a varient of garveigh ‘roaring’, or buirroogh ‘roaring’."

     Lhie shirgit er y faiyr.,     Lie shrivelled on the grass.,

Dy ymmyrkey yn errey trome?,To carry the heavy burden?,
Dagh carrey ayns yn ooig lhie croym?,Every friend lying bent in the pit?,
     Ah siyragh va my raa!,Oh! My words were hasty!,
