","     Native Manx People,— My own countrymen, listen to me, and take full note of what I am going to say—for it is worth your worry! You have heard, no doubt, of the new law they are now in the process of making, concerning a fee for permission to kill birds. What put in their heads such foolishness I do not know—unless it is so that one or two amongst them, who are fond of tasty food and game, could suppose that they could make a game of us. Sure enough in times gone past, such robbery was suffered, when there happened to be a crazed mind of a king or some lord able to keep all the good things for himself— But now people know better— they know and are confident that each man has a right to his property, and no one dare enter his circle (sphere) that he does not allow, neither will it be plundered against his will."

Is this reasonable my fellow men? Is this justice? Will you say that such a liberty is legal, or that it should be made legal, whilst there is the engergy of a louse left in Manx people! A louse, I said! It’s an insect lower than a louse that would suffer such a rebuke (insult); for it is a heavy rebuke (insult), to say the least of it, to be set upon like that in our very fields, and we aye dare to buy a deadly-weapon for our own permitted uses, without first asking for permission from— who? And if it happens that a wild goose, or duck, or partridge, or even a blackbird flies past it must be left for the first stranger, to the first thief that goes over your boundary!"

","     This would be shameful to allow in any country, far more in a country whose laws are reasonable, and wholseome and good—that gives complete freedom to everyone to do what he likes with his own property. But this very same new law has not yet been ratified by the king, neither do I believe it will be; and it is a great wonder that it was ever formed within the Island. Is it the Keys who could put their hand to such a law? Is it the entire nobility of the Island that could assume such a thing?"
"     Agh my gheiney cheerey, ny surjee leid dy ve jeant riu. Fogle jee magh nyn gharail dy ghow shiu yn leigh jeh dooinney erbee ghowys er dy hiooyl trooid ny magheryn eu lesh gun; as varramis dieu nagh lhoys da.

T’an leigh ta dy reayll dooin nyn ghooid hene ny stroshey na leigh erbee dy vel er ve jeaynt, na vys jeant dy bra.","     But my countrymen, do not suffer such to be done to you. Announce your intention that you will outlaw any man who assumes to walk through your fields with a gun; and I warrant to you he dare not. Some have done this, and they are so much the wiser; because after this the robber won’t have an excuse. The law that maintains our own property for us is stronger than any law there has been made, or will ever be made."
"     Slanelhieu. Fodde dy geayll shiu voym reesht. Ta shiartanse dy reddyn elley ta foum dy scrieu fooast, tra vees caa aym. ","     Farewell. Maybe you will hear from me again. There are several other things I intend to write yet, when I have a chance."
