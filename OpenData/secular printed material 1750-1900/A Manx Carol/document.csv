Manx,English,Notes
"TAN traa ain ceau, ta’n chor cheet er,","Our time is fleeting, the ?? is coming upon it,",
Caid vees yn ghless dy roie?,How long is the glass to run?,
Myr shoh ta shin er nyn yurnah,"Like this, we are on a journey,",
As cosney gys yn oaie.,And making our way to the grave,
"O M'annym! S'mennic ayns dty hraa,","O, My soul! How often in your time,",
Honnick oo yn shilley hreih;,"You saw the miserable sight,",
"Naboo lurg naboo cosney roish,","Of neighbour after neighbour getting on,",
As dobberan vooar ny-yeih.,And a great lamentation after him.,
"As myr gig[1] imbagh veg my geayrt,","And as a small season will come around,",[1] gig] [jig]
Shoh vees yn stayd ain hene ;,This will be our state;,
Nyn gaarjyn vees my-geayrt y mooin,Our friends who will be around about us,
As cur nyn mannaight[2] lhien.,And putting their blessings with us.,[2] manniaght] [mannaght]
"Ny sniessey, as ny sniessey tayrn,","Drawing closer, and closer,",
Gys giattyn dowin yn oaie;,To the deep gates of the grave;,
"Raad hie nyn ayraghyn rhymboo,","Where our parents went before us,",
As hig nyn sluight nyn-yeih.,And our descendants will come after.,
