"     Te dooghysagh da deiney geearee reddyn noa; cha nee eddyr son dy vel ad veg share na lheids vad cliaghtit orroo, agh eer son dy vel ad noa, as dyn oyr arragh.","     It’s natural for a man to desire new things; not at all because they are any better than the sort of thing they’re used to, but just because they’re new, and no further reason."
"     Ta aigney dooinney myr shen er ny chummey, dy vel eh graiagh er caghlaa.—Shoh dooghys yn annym beayn. Ta e breeghyn cha eearooagh nagh vel mooads erbee dy hushtey na dy schleï, fysseree erbee cha dowin as cha soiljit shen, nagh vel sthill fondagh as shegin er caghlaa ynsagh.","     A man’s mind is designed like that, that he loves change. – This is the nature of the eternal soul. Its energies are so numerous that there isn’t any amount of knowledge or of art, or information at all, so deep and so revealed that isn’t yet certain  as needing a variety of learning."
"Cha vel lheamys dy ve currit son shoh, myr foïll—er yn-oyr dy vel eh cummey nyn dooie, as dy vel eh myr shen puintit cour ymmdyyn y vea. Agh lhisagh twoaie ve currit dan jerrey.","     There’s no criticism to be given for this, as a fault – for the reason that it is the the design of our nature, and because it is appointed like that for the uses of life. But we should be aware of of the consequence. "
"     Caghlaa erbee ta jeh foays, shen as shen ynrican lhisagh ve yn ard ryd huggey dy yeeaghyn. My te jeh foays, te eisht jeh scansh, as lhisagh eh ve taaghit. Mannagh vel, lhisagh eh ve jiooldit rish. Nish ryd ta cur bra er nhee dy vel mie as vondeishagh, cha vod ryd erbee ve noi.","     Any change that is of beenefit, that, and that alone should be the chief thing to look to. If it is of benefit, then it is of importance, and it should be practiced. If not, it should be rejected. Now, something that reveals that something is good and advantageous, nothing can oppose."
"     Ta resoon, yn ardvree tayns dooinney, gynsagh shin dy plean dy vel yeearee dy ynsagh nhee erbee mie, kiarit son foays y pheiagh; as erynoyr shen, te ardcharail Yee ny ghraase dy beagh eh eiyrit da. Ta caghlaa tushtey jeh dagh nhee kiarit dy leedeil shin dys foays.","     Reason, the chief faculty of man, teaches us plainly that the desire to learn anything at all is good, intended for the good of the person, and for that reason, it is the God of Grace’s chief intention that he be followed. Diverse knowledge of  everything is intented to lead us to good."
"Er y fa shen te choud shen mie, as te ard chreenaght sheelnaue dy ooraghey lheid y meean. Son ta meeandys hene goaill cummey veihn jerrey ta jeeaghit huggey. Ta tushtey as schlei, ta resoonys as keeayll jeh caghlaaghyn sorch jeh foays, ayns wheesh as dy vel ad dys vondeish.","Therefore, so far, so good, and it is mankind’s great wisdom to refresh such a wish. For desire itself takes form from the conclusion shown to it. Art and knowledge, reason and sense of many varieties are of benefit, in so much as they are advantageous."
"Eer myr shen bentyn dan ynsagh ta rygheddin ayns coondaghyn niaghtoilagh cadjin y laa, nan shiaghtyn ta goll shiaghey. Te ooilliu son soiljaghey shin ayns caghlaaghyn nhee; te myr shen cur caa dooin jannoon reï shen lhisagh ve ayns pooar dagh unnane dy yannoo, jeh ny reddyn ta kiongoyrt rish sy theihll.","It is even like that concerning the learning that is available in ordinary news accounts of the day; like that is gives us a chance to prepare that which should be in the power of eveyone to do, for the things that evident to the world."
"Tra ta shin lhei coontaghyn jeh reilltys, jeh caghlaaghyn taghyrt fud sheshaght chadjin, marish ny reddyn ta goaill seose aignaghyn slane reilltysyn as pobble—tad ooilliu son soiljaghey as son jannoo sleih ny share bentyn da annym as callin. Tad son cur er sleih rei ny reddyn sfeeu, as shiaghney lheids ta neu vondeishagh.","     When we read accounts of governenence, of various events amongst ordinary company, together with the things that take up the minds of whole governments and people – they can all illuminate and improve  people in relation to body and soul. They can make people choose the most worthy things, and avoid such as are disadvantageous."
"     Shoh’n foays ta ayns cur magh pabyryn cour y chiaghtyn, ayndoo ta dagh nhee ta taghyrt, mie as sie, ayns coors y theihll dy baghtyll soiljit:—as shoh yn vondeish ta ayns ny jir mayd newspâbyr rish. Eryfashen, ta lheid feeu moylley, my she shen dy vel y sleih ta dy chur magh eh er cheu foays as aigneymie da deiney; bee lheid jeh foays chadjin dan slane theay.","     This is the benefit in publishing weekly papers, in which each thing that happens, good and bad, in the course of the world is clearly explained; - and this is the advantage in what we we call a newspaper. Therefore, such deserves praise, if it is the case that the people who publish it are on the side of good and goodwill for men; there will be such a common benefit for the whole public."
