,"MANANAN, a Manx Chronicle, translated from the original.",
,"     MANANAN beg, hight Mac y Ler",
,"Was he the first that ruled the land,",
,     A Paynim and a Sorcerer,
,He was as best I understand.,
,"     Not with his sword or with his bow,",
,That he his conquest could maintain;,
,"     But when as hostile fleet he saw,",
,He caused a mist to intervene.,
,"     Around the coast on every height,",
,"If he but placed a single man,",
,"     There by his Necromantick art,",
,Appeared a formidable clann.,
,"     Thus from all enemies secure,",
,"And his dominions all in peace,",
,     He long maintained a regal sway,
,O’er subjects fearless and at ease.,
,     Their yearly tribute but a load,
,"Of bent, or rushes, from the plain;",
,"     From every quarter of the land,",
,"Brought in at midsummer, a main.",
,"     Some were obliged to carry it up,",
,"And lay it down on famed Barrool,",
,"     Some were indulged below to stop,",
,At Manin’s Court above Kemool.,
,"     Thus lived the inhabitants of man,",
,"So light their tribute and so blest,",
,"     Devoid of trouble or of care,",
,"Or toil, to mar their happy rest.",
,"     But now Saint Patrick soon arrives,",
,"Superior in every art,",
,     And o’er the waves Mananan drives,
,With that viles crew that took his part.,
,&c. &c. &c. &c.,
