THE LATE REV. ROBERT BROWN. PARISH OF BRADDAN - MANX EPISTLE.,TRANSLATION OF THE MANX EPISTLE.
,To the Editor of Mona’s Herald.
,"Sir, Having read a Manx epistle in your paper, of the 30th ult., which the writer desired to be translated into English, and inserted in your last Wednesday' paper, but as no translation appeared, I thought I should try my hand at translating Manx into English, for my own amusement,—and as you say that an English translation shall readily have a place, if forwarded, I send you this, which you may insert in your next Herald, if you have not received a better. "

When he first came to this parish, he hired a Manx clergyman who understood Manx to preach to us in that language, that is to say, our mother tongue. He thought it unjust to be in a parish where all the people did not understand English, without the Gospel being to the man who understands Manx, as well as to the man who understands English. He therefore, because the Manx clergyman could not remain long with him, undertook to learn the Manx language, and in a short time, by labouring night and day, he was able to read and preach in that language. Although he himself was a Manxman, he never saw how necessary it was for a country clergyman in this Island to understand Manx, till he came among Manx people."

"

Nagh beagh shoh smooinit neu-resoonagh?

But, it would be just as reasonable for them to appoint a clergyman to each parish who did not understand English, and say, that every one who did not understand Manx, must learn it. Would not this be considered unreasonable? No doubt it would; but is it not equally so on the other hand? "
"     Ta’n Manninagh boght nagh vel toiggal monney Baarle, ga dy vel eh cha beg soit jeh, laboragh chiart cha creoi dy eeck jaghee da’n Aspick as saggyrt yn skeerey echey, as yn joarree nagh vel toiggal Gaelg. ","     The poor Manx man who does not understand much English, though he is so much despised, labours just as hard to pay tithes to the Bishop and to the clergyman of his parish, as the stranger who does not understand Manx.    "

","Must it not, then, be very trying to him when he goes to church on the Sabbath, after labouring hard all the week, that he cannot hear the Gospel preached plainly in that language which he best understands. And, again, when he comes to lie on a sick bed, that the man who is paid for doing so cannot show him the way in which he may be come prepared for his change."
"      Vel shiu smooinaghtyn dy beagh ny deiney mooarey ain booiagh lheid ve jeant roosyn, as ad ve cha beg soit jeh? Ta mee sheiltyn nagh beagh. ","Do you suppose our great men themselves would like to be treated in this way and that they were so much despised? I think not,"

","     Formerly when the clergyman of a parish died, or was removed to another parish, the minister next to him in age succeeded him; but now there are young men who can neither read nor speak Manx, appointed to the parishes, if they happen to be related to any of our rulers, and then they are compelled to get some of our poor Manx clergymen who understand Manx, and who are much older than themselves, to help them.

There are so many strangers in the House of Keys “that the Manxmen who are amongst them have not much to say;” so the strangers are get all their own way, because they think themselves wiser than the poor Manxmen."
