"Gheiney Seyrey,—ayns scrieunyn dys cummaltee yn ellan, er yn laa chaie, ghow me yn reamys dy ghra focklyn giarrey mychione cairys ta eu dys yn “elective franchise,” —ta shen dy ghra, privilege dy reigh as dy churt stiagh Kiar-as-feeid ny cheerey ain. Ayns yn scrieunyn cheddin hass mee magh noi, as dob mee firrinys goan va loayrit liorish unnane jeh ny hard leighderyn ny mastey eu, “de beagh yn privilege shoh mollaght as cha nee bannaght.” ","Gentlemen,—In a former letter, I took the liberty of addressing you upon your absolute right to the Elective Franchise, in opposition to the assertion of a leading lawyer amongst you, that “tbe Elective Franchise would be a curse, and not a blessing.” ","Gentlemen,—In a letter to the imhabitants of the Island, the other day, I took the liberty of saying a few short words about the right you have to the elective franchise, that is to say, the privilege to elect and to put in the Keys of the country. In the same letter I stood in opposition against and I denied the truth of words that were spoken by one of the chief leaders amongst you, “that this privilege would be a curse and not a blessing.”",
"Va yn resooney ayms er ny levallal noi yn Chiar-as-feeid, fir oik nagh vel shuish ayns aght erbee reigh ny pointeil; agh fir oik ta reigh as pointeil ad hene dy hassoo syn oik cheddin son ooilley laaghyn nyn mea, cha vel ocksan eu dy churt daue ny sneay dy churt orroo.

Va ny goan loayrit, ta me ginsh diu, gra “dy beagh yn phooar shoh —pooar ta slane cairys eu huick— mollaght, as cha nee bannaght.”","You will recollect that my argument was levelled against the House of Keys, whom you do not appoint —who elect themselves for life— over whom you have not the slightest control— and who make laws binding upon you and your children from generation to generation, without your consent directly or indirectly ; while his mere assertion was, that if you had the power of electing the Members of the House of Keys from time to time, amongst yourselves, and allow them to sit as your representatives for a certain specified time only, with liberty to change them afterwards, if you felt dissatisfied with their proceedings; that this privilege, or, in fact, your absolute right, would be “a curse, and not a blessing."" ","     My argument was levelled against the Keys, officials that you have not in any way elected or appointed, but officials who choose and appoint themselves to stand in the same office for all the days of their lives (for life). A rebuke of yours does not upset them. They make laws, binding upon you and your children from generation to generation. The lawyer’s words were as much as saying that if you had the power amongst yourselves, from time to time, to choose and to appoint the Keys of the country, to sit out on our behalf and on our account , for a time that would be named, and the power being maintained to change them, if you observed that they weren’t doing their utmost for the benefit of the country. The words were said, I’m telling you, to say “that this power would be—a power that you have an absolute right to—a curse, and not a blessing.” ",
"     Cha jean ym reeisht gentrail ayns cooish liour dy phrowal neufirrinys ny goan shoh, agh ayns aght giare dy hoiagh reau reddyn yinnagh cheeit mygeayrt, dy beagh yn phooar shoh ec ny Manninee, dy reigh Kiar-as-feeid ny cheerey, chammah as yn phooar dy churt dys lhiattee unnane erbee jeu, ec kione yn tra v’ad dy hassoo, nagh beagh shiu credjal va er yannoo eh phaart son foays ny cheerey.","I shall not again enter into any elaborate argument to prove to you that the very reverse of this doctrine is the truth; but plainly, simply, and very briefly state to you a few things which must necessarily follow, if you Manxmen had the appointment of the Keys in your own hands, coupled, of course, with the right to dismiss every individual member whose conduct displeased you, immediately upon the expiration of the term for which you had elected him. ","     I will not enter again into a long discourse of proving the false assertion of these words, but as a summary to set before you things that come around, were the Manx to have this power, to choose the Keys of the country, as well as the power to put aside anyone of them, at the end of the time they were to stand, were you not to believe that he had done his part for the benefit of the country.

Also, upon every tenant of lands whose rent amounted to five pounds and upwards. In towns, the right of franchise should be conferred on householders, or persons holding or occupying houses of the value of five pounds per annum. ","     I ought first to say, that it would be fair to bestow the “elective franchise,” or the right to vote for officials of the Keys, on every man in each parish who would posses in his own right, and himself owning land, buildings, or intacks worth forty shillings a year; and also on every tenant of  lands who would be paying five pounds in rent, and above. In towns, every householder paying five pounds and above per annum of house rent should have this right. ",
"Yn reigh shoh dy ve jeant, yn slane Kiar-as-feeid dy ve votit er nyn son, as jerrey dy ve currit er yn pholl ayns un laa; as slane pooar ve oc dy hassoo seose ayns ynnid nyn vir cheerey son three bleaney dy chra, ny sloo [1] ny veagh ad currit as bree, as poll noa ve ordyrit liorish Keannoort ny cheerey. ","The poll to be closed in one day, and the Members of the House to sit for three years, unless dissolved, and a new election ordered by His Excellency the Governor.","This choice being made, the entire Keys to be voted for, and the poll closed in one day; and for them to have complete power to  represent their countrymen for a duration of three years, until they would be made void dissolved, and a new poll to be ordered by the Governor of the land. ","[1] ny sloo—‘less’, here this likely a mistake in translation for ‘until’—derrey / dys / gys ['unless' in the original English. MWW]."

","This would be a rough outline of a measure for bestowing the franchise, or right of voting, amongst you, the details of which might be filled up at leisure. This is your right, your absolute right, and no matter of favour.","     This is as an outline, or short sketch, of the plan that should be taken to bestow amongst you the ‘franchise’, or the power to elect the Keys of the country; to be filled out subsequently; and it is a power that is your right, and you have absolute right to it without favour from any man. ",
     Nee’m nish genmys gha ny three jeh ny vondeishyn yinnagh gerree voish yn plan sho dy ve currit ayns bree. ,"Some few of the advantages that would speedily result from a real House of Keys, formed upon this plan, would be—",     I will now name a few of the advantages that arise from this plan to be enacted. ,

","That the House would really and truly represent the wants, wishes, and desires of Manxmen; and in that capacity, would firmly insist upon their being attended to. ","     The Keys would then truly represent the people; they would give an ear (lend and ear) to the complaints of the people, and with boldness stand up on their behalf, against any tyranny that would threaten against them, and for everything that would be required and needed to be done for them. ",
"     Myr t’ad nish er nyn reih, cha vel ad jannoo yn cheid unnane jeh ny reddyn sho, as cha loayst daue yn unnane elley y yannoo.","As at present constituted, it does not do the former, and it dares not do the latter.","     As they are now selected, they do not do the former, and they dare not do the latter.

",

","That the people themselves would have the appointment of the Road Trustees, and the regulation and control of the funds raised fur the improvement of the highways, as well as the appointment of all surveyors and officers appointed under the Board, whether chosen by parishes, by sheadings or by one general committee elected for the whole Island.","     The people would have the power of the appointment of the Road Trustees; and they would have under their care (regulation) the taxes raised from themselves to make new roads, and to maintain the same roads. They would have, moreover, the appontment of every official connected to the roads under the Board, whether it is decided that the said appointment be by parishes, by sheadings, or by committee on account of the whole Island.","[2] er reigh—‘whether chosen’?. Unattested elswhere in the corpus. This piece was written as a free translation of a letter by the same ‘Brittanicus’ that appeared above the Manx version. In the English letter the writer notes: “These few hints may suffice for the present; and as they are intended chiefly for the eye of natives, who may not so readily appreciate them in the language of the Saxon. I, who am somewhat conversant with the dialect of the ancient Gael, have endeavoured to submit them underneath in that tongue, which must be enshrined in the heart and affection of every Manxman.” The equivalent phrase in the English reads “whether chosen by parishes, by sheadings or by one general committee elected for the whole Island”."

"Veagh ec yn sleih yn chairys dy reigh daue hene Briwnyn beggey ny baljyn mairgee, as persoonyn jeh yn un oik fud yn cheer, marish dagh fer ayns oik injyl trooid balley as cheer.","That the people would have the unquestioned right to choose their own High Bailiffs or Chief Magistrates of the towns, by vote, and all the subordinate officers of parochial and town police.","     The people would have the right to choose for themselves the chief magistrates of the towns, and persons of the same office throughout the country, as well as each subordinate officer through town and country.",

The entire revenue would be disbursed by overseers appointed by the people; and insomuch as a portion of this tax would be falling upon themselves, it would be to their advantage to be as economic as is in their power in the expenditure of the money.

","All rates leviable for the improvement of the towns would of course be raised and applied in a similar manner, with this grand difference, that THEY would be collected from the inhabitants of the towns exclusively. ","     Taxes for supporting the towns would be raised in the same way, but these would be paid in full by the inhabitants of the town.",
