"Dys Manninee dooie, cummaltee Ellan Vannin.",To The Natives Of The Isle Of Man.,
"Gheiney Seyrey,—ayns screeuyn dys cummaltee yn ellan, er yn laa chaie, ghow mee yn reamys dy ghra focklyn giarrey mychione cairys ta eu dys yn “elective franchise”—ta shen dy ghra, privilege dy reih as dy choyrt stiagh Kiare-as-Feed ny çheerey ain. Ayns yn screeuyn cheddin hass mee magh noi as dob mee firrinys goan va loayrit liorish unnane jeh ny hard leighderyn ny mast’eu, “dy beagh yn privilege shoh mollaght as cha nee bannaght.” ","Gentlemen,—In a letter to the imhabitants of the Island, the other day, I took the liberty of saying a few short words about the right you have to the elective franchise, that is to say, the privilege to elect and to put in the Keys of the country. In the same letter I stood in opposition against and I denied the truth of words that were spoken by one of the chief leaders amongst you, “that this privilege would be a curse and not a blessing.”",
"Va’n resooney aym’s er ny levallal noi yn Chiare-as-Feed, fir-oik nagh vel shiuish ayns aght erbee reih ny pointeil, agh fir-oik ta reih as pointeil ad hene dy hassoo ’syn oik cheddin son ooilley laghyn nyn mea: cha vel oghsan eu dy choyrt daue ny sneih dy choyrt orroo. T’ad jannoo leighyn, ta kiangley shiuish as nyn gloan, veih sheeloghe dys sheeloghe. Va goan yn leighder wheesh as gra, dy beagh yn phooar eu ny mast’eu hene, voish traa gys traa dy reih as dy phointeil Kiare-as-Feed ny çheerey, dy hoie ass nyn lieh as er nyn goontey, son traa veagh er ny enmys, as yn phooar ve freilt dy chaghlaa ad, my yinnagh shiu my-ner nagh row ad jannoo nyn gooid share son foays ny çheerey. Va ny goan loayrit, ta mee ginsh diu, gra “dy beagh yn phooar shoh—pooar ta slane cairys eu huic—mollaght, as cha nee bannaght.”","     My argument was levelled against the Keys, officials that you have not in any way elected or appointed, but officials who choose and appoint themselves to stand in the same office for all the days of their lives (for life). A rebuke of yours does not upset them. They make laws, binding upon you and your children from generation to generation. The lawyer’s words were as much as saying that if you had the power amongst yourselves, from time to time, to choose and to appoint the Keys of the country, to sit out on our behalf and on our account , for a time that would be named, and the power being maintained to change them, if you observed that they weren’t doing their utmost for the benefit of the country. The words were said, I’m telling you, to say “that this power would be—a power that you have an absolute right to—a curse, and not a blessing.” ",
"     Cha jeanym reesht gentrail ayns cooish liauyr dy phrowal neu-firrinys ny goan shoh, agh ayns aght ","     I will not enter again into a long discourse of proving the false assertion of these words, but as a summary to set before you things that come around, were the Manx to have this power, to choose the Keys of the country, as well as the power to put aside anyone of them, at the end of the time they were to stand, were you not to believe that he had done his part for the benefit of the country.  ",
"giare dy hoiagh reue reddyn yinnagh çheet mygeayrt, dy beagh yn phooar shoh ec ny Manninee, dy reih Kiare-as-Feed ny çheerey, chammah as yn phooar dy choyrt dys lhiattee unnane erbee jeu, ec kione yn traa v’ad dy hassoo, nagh beagh shiu credjal va er yannoo e phaart son foays ny çheerey.",,
"     Lhisin hoshiaght gra, dy beagh eh cairagh dy stowal yn “elective franchise,” ny yn chairys dy votal son fir-oik yn Chiare-as-Feed, er dy chooilley ghooiney ayns dagh skeerey veagh ayns possession ayns yn chairys echey hene, as da hene bentyn thalloo, thieyn, ny intackyn feeu daeed skillin ’sy vlein; as myrgeddin er dagh cotler thallooin veagh geeck queig puint mayl, as erskyn. Ayns ny baljyn-margee lhisagh yn chairys shoh ve ec dagh cummaltagh geeck queig puint ’sy vlein dy vayl thie, as erskyn.","     I ought first to say, that it would be fair to bestow the “elective franchise,” or the right to vote for officials of the Keys, on every man in each parish who would posses in his own right, and himself owning land, buildings, or intacks worth forty shillings a year; and also on every tenant of  lands who would be paying five pounds in rent, and above. In towns, every householder paying five pounds and above per annum of house rent should have this right. ",
"Yn reih shoh dy ve jeant, yn slane Kiare-as-Feed dy ve votit er nyn son, as jerrey dy ve currit er yn pholl ayns un laa; as slane pooar ve oc dy hassoo seose ayns ynnyd nyn vir-çheerey son three bleeaney dy hraa, ny sloo[1] ny veagh ad currit ass bree, as poll noa ve oardyrit liorish Kiannoort ny çheerey. ","This choice being made, the entire Keys to be voted for, and the poll closed in one day; and for them to have complete power to  represent their countrymen for a duration of three years, until they would be made void dissolved, and a new poll to be ordered by the Governor of the land. ","[1] ny sloo—‘less’, here this likely a mistake in translation for ‘until’—derrey / dys / gys."
"     Ta shoh myr oirr mooie, ny sketch giare, jeh’n plan lhisagh ve er ny ghoaill dy stowal ny mast’eu yn “franchise,” ny yn phooar dy reih Kiare-as-Feed ny çheerey: dy ve lhieent seose ny lurg shen; as t’eh pooar ta cairys, as slane cairys eu huggey fegooish foayr voish dooinney erbee. ","     This is as an outline, or short sketch, of the plan that should be taken to bestow amongst you the ‘franchise’, or the power to elect the Keys of the country; to be filled out subsequently; and it is a power that is your right, and you have absolute right to it without favour from any man. ",
     Nee’m nish genmys ghaa ny three jeh ny vondeishyn yinnagh girree voish yn plan shoh dy ve currit ayns bree. ,     I will now name a few of the advantages that arise from this plan to be enacted. ,
"     Veagh yn Chiare-as-Feed eisht ayns firrinys ny hassoo ayns ynnyd yn theay; yinnagh ad cur cleaysh gys accanyn yn sleih, as lesh daanys shassoo seose ass nyn lieh, noi tranlaasee erbee veagh er nyn vaggyrt nyn oi, as er son dagh nhee veagh ymmyrçhagh as femoil dy ve jeant er nyn son. ","     The Keys would then truly represent the people; they would give an ear (lend and ear) to the complaints of the people, and with boldness stand up on their behalf, against any tyranny that would threaten against them, and for everything that would be required and needed to be done for them. ",
"     Myr t’ad nish er nyn reih, cha vel ad jannoo yn chied unnane jeh ny reddyn shoh, as cha lhoys daue yn unnane elley y yannoo.","     As they are now selected, they do not do the former, and they dare not do the latter. ",

"     Currit ayns pooar liorish yn theay, yinnagh ad jeeaghyn lurg argid cadjin ny çheerey as shassoo seose ayns nyn ynnyd, as goaill kiarail dy beagh coontey firrinagh currit jeh, as dy row eh er ny vaarail son ny reddyn smoo ymmyrçh as femoil.","     Put into power by the people, they would look after the common revenues of the country and stand up in their stead, and take care that a true account would be given of it, and that it was spent for most pressing and needed things. ",
"     Veagh yn phointeil jeh trusteeghyn ny raaidyn ayns laue yn sleih; as veagh oc fo’n chiarail oc ny keeshyn troggit voue hene dy yannoo raaidyn noa, as dy chummal seose ny raaidyn cheddin. Veagh oc marish shoh yn phointeil jeh dagh fer-oik bentyn dys ny raaidyn fo ny hard reiltee, er reigh[2] da’n phointeil cheddin ve liorish skeeraghyn, liorish sheidjinyn, ny liorish committee er coontey yn slane ellan.   ","     The people would have the power of the appointment of the Road Trustees; and they would have under their care (regulation) the taxes raised from themselves to make new roads, and to maintain the same roads. They would have, moreover, the appontment of every official connected to the roads under the Board, whether it is decided that the said appointment be by parishes, by sheadings, or by committee on account of the whole Island.","[2] er reigh—‘whether chosen’?. Unattested elswhere in the corpus. This piece was written as a free translation of a letter by the same ‘Brittanicus’ that appeared above the Manx version. In the English letter the writer notes: “These few hints may suffice for the present; and as they are intended chiefly for the eye of natives, who may not so readily appreciate them in the language of the Saxon. I, who am somewhat conversant with the dialect of the ancient Gael, have endeavoured to submit them underneath in that tongue, which must be enshrined in the heart and affection of every Manxman.” The equivalent phrase in the English reads “whether chosen by parishes, by sheadings or by one general committee elected for the whole Island”."

"Veagh ec yn sleih yn chairys dy reih daue hene briwnyn beggey ny baljyn-margee, as persoonyn jeh’n un oik fud yn çheer, marish dagh fer ayns oik injil trooid balley as çheer.","     The people would have the right to choose for themselves the chief magistrates of the towns, and persons of the same office throughout the country, as well as each subordinate officer through town and country.",
"     Cha beagh ’sy traa shen, keesh, ta goit rish dy ve ymmyrçhagh as femoil son cummal seose boghtyn yn ellan, cur aggle as creau ayns ny heirinnee as ny","     There would then be a tax, that is admitted to be imperative and necessary for the support of the poor of the Island, causing fear and trembling for the farmers and the householders, inasmuch as the same tax would be ordered and raised by themselves each year, the same taxes to be put on the land, on tithes, and on house rentals—the heaviest proportion to fall, as it ought to, on the wealthiest people. The entire revenue would be disbursed by overseers appointed by the people; and insomuch as a portion of this tax would be falling upon themselves, it would be to their advantage to be as economic as is in their power in the expenditure of the money. ",
"cummaltee, son wheesh as dy beagh yn cheesh cheddin er ny oardrail as er ny hroggal lioroo hene dagh blein, ny keeshyn cheddin dy ve currit er y thalloo, er jagheeyn, as er mayl thieyn—yn ayrn smoo dy huittym, myr lhisagh eh, er yn sleih jeh’n verçhys smoo.

"     Veagh keeshyn son cummal seose ny baljyn-margee er ny hroggal ’syn aght cheddin, agh veagh ad shoh ayns y clane er ny eeck liorish cummaltee yn valley. ","     Taxes for supporting the towns would be raised in the same way, but these would be paid in full by the inhabitants of the town.",

","     I have written these short words to you, who are native Manx people in the mother tongue (Manx), undertaking that that which I wish to explain to you will be understood better in that language. ",
"     Foddee eh ve dy jean shiu clashtyn voym keayrt ennagh elley mychione ny reddyn shoh; ayns y traa t’ayn, creid shiu mee dy ve,","     It may be that you will hear from me about these things some other time, in the meantime, believe me to be,",
