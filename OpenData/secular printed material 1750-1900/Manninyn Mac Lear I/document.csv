","Sir,— I have noticed the many favours you have done in this little Island, by blowing your trumpet. Be wary of the “Old Practitioner” who was writing to you the other week, and don’t give him permission to write like one of your many leaders. When I read his letters, there was a smell of the old fox off it, so heavy and sour that I had to shut (hold) my nose. I happened once to be in the castle, and I perceived the same smell there.",

The Deemsters and Lawyers were before that time all on the same side; now there is a kind of justice actioned for the people, by means of the melody of one and the singing of the other. That old fox argues lowly enough, and he is undertaking to win cases like he used to. I’m not denying that there aren’t one or two of the young lawyers that wear a tail, like little dogs with men’s faces.
