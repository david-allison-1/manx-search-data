This printed manuscript is arranged in 18 stanzas, which fits the description of the version used for the Manx ‘penny readings’ art Peel and Douglas in 1872. The ballad was performed in Peel by Juan Quirk of Dalby, and in Douglas by Harry Quilliam of Peel. It is said to have been composed in 1787 by Quayle ‘Vessee’. See “Arrane mysh ny baatyn va caillit ec Doolish ’sy vlein 1787. Septr. 20th” C. 1850 for a manuscript version of the ballad — which is longer, and differs somewhat in order, language and content.
