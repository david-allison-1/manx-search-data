Reports mention crowds of up to 10,000 turning up in Douglas to cheer his visits, in appreciation of his support for political reform and universal suffrage for the House of Keys and his efforts to liberalise trade between the Isle of Man and the UK. Bowring Road (Bayr Gheinnee), Ramsey, was re-named after him, and there are adverts for collections of his poetry and hymns, as well for portraits of him, in papers of the time."
