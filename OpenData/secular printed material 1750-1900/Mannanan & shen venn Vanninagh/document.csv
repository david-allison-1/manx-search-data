"Yn Chenn-Ven.— Moghrey-vie ort, Vannanan-veg-vac-y-Leirr, ta yindys orrym dy veeteil rhyts ayns shoh.

I’ve been looking for you all around for many years, without any sign of you.",
"Mannanan. — O my ven ennoil! te gerjaghey my chree dy veeteil rhyts er-yn-oyr dy vel my heaghyn er ve wheesh, as my chaarjin cha goaun ta red beg dy haggloo rhyts keayrt elley aa-vioghey my chree as te gymmyrkey lheid y voggey ayns my annym, as nagh vel mee er nennaghtyn son ymmodee bleeantyn.  ","Mannanan. — O my beloved woman! It comforts my heart to meet you for the reason that my troubles have been so great, and my friends so scarce, that a little talk to you once again revives my heart and it brings forth such joy in my soul that I haven’t felt for many years.",
"Yn Ven.— Cre ta dooghys dty heaghyn, O vannanan-veg-vac-y-Leirr, as cre voish te er jeet? ","The Woman. - What is the nature of your trouble, O Mannanan-beg-mac-y-Leirr, and where has it come from?",

As cre ta’n eiyrtys echey nish ? ","Mannanan.— You amaze me to be asking such questions of me, dear old woman. Very well you know that I have been a king in the Isle of Man, but at an unfortuitous hour, and through the trickery of foreigners, I was cast down from the",
,highest tower-peak of nobility and power to the most debased state of poverty in the Island.  And what is the consequence of that now? ,
"     T’ad’syn nagh vod ve er nyn soyllaghey rhyms, ayns aght erbee, edyr ayns ynsagh, ny tushtey, ny keeayll, jeeaghyn orrym ayns faghid, as gymmyrkey ad hene hym myr rish roosteyr.

Hug ad lhieu hym, dy chooilley vlein, kuse dy hraagh lheannagh-reeastagh er-nonney leaghyr veih mullagh varrool dys thie-chummal my ard-er-oik ec cosh y Chlieay.","     Those that couldn’t be compared to me in any way, either in education, or knowledge, or sense, are looking at me in scorn, and behave towards me as they would towards a bandit. Once upon a time those who were under my rule respected me, and they loved me. They brought to me, every year, a few rough meadow straws, or else coarse grass from the top of Barrule, to the dwelling-house of my chief officer at the foot of the mountain.",
"     Eer cooiney yn Ellan ain ve argid foalsey, mannagh row yn eilley hroor-chassagh er ny chleughey er; agh nish my henn ven ennoil, ta mee eiyrit ersooyl veih ynnydyn-vaghee ny bio-ee dy rouail er y traie rish oirr-ny-marrey, ny er mullagh ny sleityn.

Even the small few pennies that are to be found with my mark on them, they’re thrown in a corner as counterfeit, the only thing they have now to uphold memories of the old times, is spreading a few rushes on Tynwald Hill.",
Yn Ven.—C’raad eisht ta’n Chummal ayd nish?,The Woman. - Where then is your dwelling now? ,
"Mannanan.—Son ymmodee bleeantyn va mee cummal ayns guag vooar yn Valla-ghyr, as va mee, paayrt dy cheayrtyn, taaghey tholtanyn Caishtal Purt-ny-hinshey, agh va mee immanit roym lioroosyn va gra dy row mee yn “voddey-dhoo.” Fakin er-y-fa-shen dy row my vioys ayns gaue, hie mee roym dys spooyt vooar Ghlione-vaïe.

There they dealt with me like the Phynnodderee; therefore I shook the dust off my feet against the people the of Gordon and Glen Maye, and off on my way with me, straight through merry Glen Rushen Glen, I took lodging at last in the chasms at Cregneash.",
"     Agh, cre bheeu shen, ta ny joarreeyn shoh te’r jeet ny vud ain cha steetagh - as cha lane dy pheeikearys, dy daink ad lesh trimmidyn vooarey leoaie, kianlt dys teddyn liauyrey — gimman y tedd ayns scoltaghyn-ny-creggey — as leaystaney eh veih cheu dy heu, feiyral as jannoo tharmane, dy dagglee ad mee as roie mee roym dys Langness ec Runnysfie ; agh eer ayns shen cha voddey duirree mee, son er-yn-on er-yn-oyr nagh row thie-lossan-lhuingys dy hauail bioys shiauldeyryn voghtey, va my chree bunnys brisht cheu-sthie jeem ec fakin wheesh dy chragh jeant jeh lhongyn — brisht ayns peeshyn mynney er ny creggyn, as ec geaishtagh rish eamyn atchimagh shialteyryn voghtey baih, fegooish cooney dy hauail ad.","     But what worth was that?  These foreigners that have come amongst us so sneakily - and so full of prying, that they came with big lead weights, tied to long ropes — driving the rope into the chasms of the rock — and swinging it from side to side, making noise and thunder, so that they frightened me and I ran off to Langness at Ronaldsway ; but even there I couldn’t stay long, for, because there wasn’t a ‘ship flame house’ (lighthouse ) to save the lives of poor sailors, my heart was almost broken inside of me at seeing so much carnage made of ships — smashed into tiny pieces on the rocks, and listening to the terrible cries of poor sailors drowning, without help to save them.",
"     Cha voddagh ennaghtyn my chree shassoo eh veg sodjey, as hie mee roym dys ny sleityn, Jiass as Twoaie, yn daa Varrool, Cronk-yn-irree-laa, Sniaull, Slieau-Whallian—as sleityn elley yn Ellan, nagh row foddey voish y traïe, raad va mee dy kinjagh faarkey. Agh va’n shee aym reesht er ny vrishey ’sy Chlieau. Chreck ad ny sleityn voghtey voym as voish y Theay.","     The feelings of my heart could not stand it any longer, and I went on my way to the mountains, South and North, the two Barrules, Cronk-yn-irree-laa, Snaefell, Slieau Whallian - and the other mountains of the Island that weren’t far from the shore where I was always bathing. But my peace was again broken on the Mountain. They sold the poor mountains (away), from me and from the people.",
"     Choud’s daag ad yn reiltys dyms[1], va wheesh ec y Theay, dy ghra rish ny sleityn as voc dys yn aer er-nyn-skyn as ny ushtaghyn mygeayrt-y-moo.

But now all the way from Douglas Head to Maughold Head and over all the mountains of the Isle of Man, that have staked them out with big sticks like a battering-ram, and they’ve put a big English name on the portions, that you and I—my old companion, don’t understand very well, because Manx is our mother tongue — and we don’t care for their English.","[1] dym’s—'to me’, this is more usually dooys, or, unstressed; dou. Dooyrt Leslie Quirk rish Rob Teare dy row ny loayrtee ren eh gynsagh Gaelg voue ny keayrtyn gra dym as dym’s ayns ynnyd dou as dooys."

But what a wonderful thing, Woman! (Along with everything else they’ve done) at Port Erin, on the westward sea coast of our Island, they’ve buried in the waters of the sea hundreds and thousands of tons of rocks from the Howe, in the bay, and have ruined the little port that was there before, that used to be a place of safety from the Calf to the Point of Ayre.",
Yn Chenn Ven.—Agh Vannanan voght c’raad ta dty chummal nish ? ,"The Old Woman. - But poor Mannanan, where is your dwelling now?",
"Mannanan.— Ta mee nish cummal ayns unnane jeh ny glionteenyn sbwoïe ’syn Ellan ain, ta shen dy ghra “Glione-valure, ec Rumsaa, agh ta aggle orrym, eer ayns shen, nagh bee my hee, as my vaynrys foddey beayn, son er y gherrit shoh ta mee er chlashtyn yllagh as eam feer neu-ghooghyssagh gra, “c’raad t’ou Adam?” (Adaue.)","Mannanan. - I now live in one of the prettiest glens in our Island, namely, “Ramsey’s Ballure Glen, but I’m afraid, even there, that my peace and my happiness won’t last long, for recently I have heard very unnatural shouting and calling, saying; “Where are you Adam?” (Adaue).",
"     Heïll mee, hoshiaght ooilley, dy row ny eam-yn hreih shoh cheet voish fer ta abyl loayrt ass e volg, son haink y choraa ec caghlaaghyn cheayrt voish dagh Skeerey runt mygeayrt.","     I supposed, first of all, that these miserable cries were coming from a ventriloquist (man able to speak from his stomach), because the voice came at different times from every parish round about.",
"     Eisht laa dy row vrie mee jeh Ferrish va mee ainjyssagh urree as dinsh ee do’u, dy rou ny coraaghyn va mee er chlashtyn cheet voish Credjuagh dy row ta soilshaghey magh yn aigney echey paayrt dy cheayrtyn da’n Theay—as, goaill aggle, dy voddagh paayrt dy leih smooinaghtyn dy row yn kynney echey, keayrt ny keayrt ennagh, er jeet neose veih buggane-vooar-Gob-ny-Scuit, t’eh baarail yn chooid smoo jeh’n traa echey ayns arganey rish y sleih, as gennaghtyn feer imneagh dy jinnagh yn cheid ghooinney va hoshiaght er ny chroo reesht cheet er-ash, as cur e chooney da, dy chur dy lhiattee dy chooilley vee-ourys dy row mooinjerys eddyr eh-hene as y vuggane (buggane-vooar-gob-ny-Scuit) veagh dy kinjagh gyllagh ’syn egin hreih echey - “craad t’ou Adam ?” Ga-reih da’n choontey shoh currit dooys ec yn ferrish jeh ny eamyn hreih va mee clashtyn, ve yn irriney ny dyn, fys feer vie t’aym pene nagh voddym shassoo eh monney sodjey.","     Then one day I asked a Fairy I was aquainted with and she told me that the voices I had heard were coming from a certain old Believer who reveals his mind sometimes to the people — and, afraid that some people could think that his kin had, at some time or other, descended from the big buggane of Gob-ny-Scuit, he uses up most of his time arguing with the people, and feeling very anxious that the first man who was first created would come back again and give him his help to put aside every suspicion that there was a blood connection between himself and the buggane (the big buggane of Gob-ny-Scuit) would be constantly shouting in his agony - “where are you Adam?” Albeit this account, given to me by the fairy, of the miserable shouts I was hearing, be the truth or not, I very well know myself that I won’t be able to stand it much longer.",

If you, in your governance, had fastened your halter a little bit more, and had put a restraint (rope tied from the horn or head to the leg) on the cow that breaks over fences, this calamity wouldn’t have overtaken us so fast, for sorrows and anguish have come upon me as well as upon yourself.",

","Mannanan. — With all respect to your judgment, my good partner, I am ready to maintain that there has been no governance at all in the Isle of Man to be compared with my own governing. In the days of my rule, the people were living in peace and happiness. They weren’t taxed as they are now. There was no compulsory highway labour for them at all, except a little bit for the big roads. There were no drunkards amongst them, and therefore, there was no need at all in my Island for a big beautiful Palace for crazy people.",

"“Yn chuilleig-hashtee va gollym[2] jeh’n chostrayl, ","“The store corner was empty of the bottle, ",[2] gollym—‘empty’. Follym—is the usual word for ‘empty’. Both folmaghey and golmaghey are found for emptying.

Again they found me out there and drove me away - and now for the last time - I have come to the mountains of our sweet old Island to take the last sight of her, with the sea coasts, to go forth from the land forever, to Cleveland in America, that will love me and take pity on me, for they speak my own language and uphold her every day.",

","The Old Woman - They were indeed glorious times, but although your commands and laws were “a terror to evil works” Rom. XIII.3. still, there was no power at all in them without being spoken in my name. I argued the cases of the orphans (children without a father or mother) and the widows with the most forceful fluency — and on the seat of judgement where I always sat to arrange the affairs of the public, I always adhered to the side of love and a spirit of charity —neither did I suffer for any witness to be punished by a crooked legality and crooked technical tricks — I pronounced the fate of the guilty in very solemn words.",

By my advice, they lived together in peace and comfort but alas those delightful days have gone forever.",

Our mountains have been sold, we are all subject to tax, thousands of the income of the Island is buried in the sea — there are habits that have come amongst us that have ruined good manners, such as hooped petticoats, bonnets without a back or a top and shaggy rolls twisted together set behind the heads of our women just like hayricks.
