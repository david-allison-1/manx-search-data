[Cover note]:,,
Rev John Kewley of Ballafreer,,
His address in Manks on the outrageous claims of the Duke of Atholl,,
C 1805[1],,"[1] This date is much too late, inasmuch as the reply to it printed by Briscoe is dated June 1790. NB 1790 in the English text is rendered y vlein shoh (this year) in the Manx."
"The Rev John Kewley of Ballafreer was Chaplain of St. Matthews, Dglas. 1802-1810, He was also Master of the Grammar Schl. For that period. He had an assistant named McMeekin, Probably father of the McMeiken, Castletown.",,
WC.,,
My Chaarjyn as[2],MY FRIENDS AND COUNTRYMEN!,[2] as—‘and’—this word is in a lighter ink – perhaps ‘My chaarjyn’ was judged to be sufficient by the original writer.
"     Myr ta Duke yn ’Nhellan shoh jercyt rish ayns traa giare, as toogeil er ny ghoail dy gheddyn ^{Enmyn gys} Scriuyn dy vooise dy ve currit da, te feer ymmyrchagh dy hoiljagh diu kys ta cooishyn shassoo eddyr yn Ellan as eshyn, dy vod shiu briwnys vel yn cheet echey gys yn[3] ’nhellan son y foas echey hene ny son y vieys euish.","     As the Duke of this island is expected shortly, and pains are taken to procure names to a very Extraordinary Address to His Grace, It becomes highly necessary to explain how matters stand between the Island and him, that you may be able to judge whether his visit is meant to answer his own purpose or for your good. ",[3] In the manuscript the n of yn is struck through.
"     Tra haink Chiarn yn ’Nhellan shoh ayns Possession jeh Ellan Vannin, yn chied toshiaght ren eh dy vrishey yn Act jeh ^{y} Settlement[4], foh’n smooinaght nagh row ny Eirinee veg agh Tennys, ayns ny Baljyn oc, choud’s ballish yn Chiarn, as nagh row e Ayr veg agh Tennys son traa e Vioase[5], tra ren eh yannoo eh; son yn Oer shoh va Cooish liauyr scruit as soit kion-ennee roish three Ard-leig^{h}daryn[6] ayns Saghsyn, son ny smooinaghtyn oc, agh va ny smooinaghtyn oc noie  Chiarn yn Ellan. myr shoh, yn naa hrial ren eh va ’sy vlein 1780 dy chur lesh Bill jeh’n Keint ’sdanjeareee roish Parliament Haghsyn fegooish yn toiggal sloo ^{y choyrt jeh} da Cummaltee Vannin.","     When His Grace came into possession of the Lordship of Mann, the first attempt was to attack and invade the Act of Settlement, under an Idea that the Land-Owners were Tennants-at-will to their Estates, and that his Ancestor was only Tenant-in-Tail at the time of passing it : To this End a voluminous Case was laid  before three eminent Lawyers in England for their Opinion, which happened to be against his Grace. Thus Circumstanced, his next attempt was in 1780, to bring a Bill of a most dangerous kind into the British Parliament, without the smallest Notice to you. ","[4] The word jeh is struck through here, so it seems ‘yn Act jeh Settlement’ (The Act of Settlement) has been changed to ‘yn Act Settlement’ (the Settlement Act).
[5] son traa e vioase] son traa e vioys — ‘for the time of his natural life’. This is underlined in the manuscript.
[6] Ard-leig^{h}daryn] ard-leighderyn – ‘lawyers’."

By their means you’ll recollect the Act of Settlement was obtained, after your Tenures had been destroyed by his Grace’s Forefathers. ","[7] Of] this word is struck through.
[8] va’n Act of y Settlement] clearly the writer was not sure of how to translate ‘The Act of Settlement’, and seems to have begun with ‘’n Act of Settlement’, then decided to drop the ‘of’ and use a lexically English (except for the article), but grammatically Manx version, and seems to have been undecided between ‘Act y Settlement’ — ‘The Act of the Settlement’, and ‘’n Act Settlement’ — ‘The Settlement Act’."
"     Ren yn Bill danjearagh shoh (marish uilk elley) geearee myr Leigh nagh voddagh persoon erbee Creck, setlal ny cur gi^{o}all[9] e Halloo fegooish Licence veih’n Chiarn son yn Oer shen cheddin","     This obnoxious Bill (amongst other evils) enacted for Law, that no man should sell, settle, or mortgage his Estate without a licence from his Grace for that purpose.",[9] gi^{o}all] gioal — ‘mortgage’

"     Dy noagh yn Chiarn reesht yn Custom skeddan as yeastagh ny baig^{ec}hyn[12], ta’n Parliament er churt dy reayl seose as dy choamrey ny Purtyn ^{euish} lesh.",     And that his Grace should repossess the Herring-Custom and Bay-Fisheries which have been graciously applied by Parliament to the Support of your Harbours.,[12] baig^{ec}hyn] the intended word here must be ‘baihaghyn’—‘bays’.
"     ’Sy vlein 1781 va Bill jeh’n Dooghys cheddin currit lesh roish yn Parliament, agh va stap currit er liorish yn chiare as feeid, as haink eh gys veg.","     In 1781, a similar Bill was brought into Parliament, opposed by the Keys, and also fell.",
"     Va ny Billyn shoh faagit da daa Ard-lighder[13] Hornear y Ree ayns Saghsyn as yn chied unnane jeu da Fir-oik yn Ree ’sy ’nhellan, ta shen da Mr. Moore, (yn Briw), Tornear yn Ree, as Clearagh ny lioaryn, chur[14] yn chooish noie yn Chiarn.","     These bills were referred to [the] Attorney and Solicitor-General of England, and the first of them to the Crown-Lawyers of the Island, namely Mr. MOORE, (the Deemster,)  the Attorney-General of the Island, and Clerk of the Rolls, whose Reports were directly against his Grace.","[13] daa Ard-lighder] daa ard-leighder ‘two chief lawyers’. This is struck through in the manuscript.
[14] The original manuscript has ‘agh chur ad, but the words ‘agh’ and ‘ad’ are struck through."

(Examples of  ‘easal’ meaning ‘easy’ are also found in Late Spoken Manx)."
"     ’Sy Vlein 1787 va’n Chiarn ’sy’nhellan, va Tagloo eddyr eh hene as yn Chiare as feeid, as ghiall eh dy ch insh daue roish yinnagh eh reesht lesh Bill gys y Phiarliament mychione yn ’Nhellan, fegooish geill da e Ghialdyn, va Bill currit lesh ayns firrinys er y hoshiaght ’sy Vlein shoh fegooish fockle veih mychione echey.","     In 1787 his Grace was in the Island, had a Conference with the Keys, and promised to give them notice before he again brought any Bill into the British parliament respecting the Island. Notwithstanding this promise, a Bill was actually brought forward in 1790, without any notice whatever. ",
"     Ren yn Chiare as feeid, kianlt dy reayl Arrey daue diuish as daue hene, shassoo noie lesh yn ai vie cheddin, as va’n Bill currit gyn vree.","     The Keys --- bound to watch for you and for themselves --- opposed it as before, and with similar success; the Bill was thrown out. ",

",[16] toiggal y churt — these words are struck through in the manuscript.

And why not bring his action for the recovery of them, in his Majesty’s Courts, in the King’s Courts, which are open to him and every other Subject? Instead of pursuing this mode of proceeding, he takes a new method of attempting to recover his pretended Rights, by bill in parliament.",[17] t’eh ? – this word is illegible in the script – ‘t’eh?’ has been chosen to fit. (RT 2001)
"     Cha lias da ve inshit diu, dy row eck Carrey as leider yn Chiarn ayns Thie yn p^{h}arliament, yn vieys dy hoilshagh dy foshlit, dy row yn Bill stierree va enmissyt[18] bentyn gys Possession yn Cummaltee yn Ellan as cha nee gys yn Chairys oc.","     It need not be told you that his Grace’s great friend and Support in the House of Commons, had the Candor to assert in a public Speech, that the last mentioned Bill would affect the Possessions, but not the Right of the Inhabitants. ","[18] ‑it changed to ‑yt, or vice versa."

If any of you can say that any one amongst you is possessed of things belonging to his Grace, why do you not give them up? but, if you do not admit that, you must say that the Duke wants from you possessions which he has no right to.","[19] FLAOILL, plain, smooth, level, in its original meaning, as Er Eden jeeaghyn nish flaoill ayns e hilley. P. C. but now it usually signifies smooth, and flowing in speech, which arises from associating with it the sound of the English word flow. (Kelly. J. Fockleyr Gaelgagh).
[20] belongal] ‘belonging’ — this word has been struck through in the original.
[21] ‘ggey’ is struck through in the manuscript. The alterations here show ‘huggey’ has been altered to huck."

This, no doubt, would be acting with uncommon liberality. But can it be conceived that the minister will, or would, be allowed to, load the English Funds with the Sum to be paid his Grace? No! You must naturally conclude that it must fall on the Surplus of the Revenues of the Isle; probably he may obtain the whole of these Revenues, after paying the Civil List and Charges of Collection.

I shall leave you to judge of the fatal and injurious Consequences that must arise to this Isle: Poverty and Ruin would inevitably follow:  In a little time there would not be a single Guinea amongst you, every thing would be carried off.  Whilst the Revenues remain in the Hands of Government, they will probably be applied to some public uses amongst us, as they have hitherto been; but if once they are diverted to the Use of a private Individual, farewell to the happiness and prosperity of the Island! The landed property must immediately decrease in its value, and the Inhabitants of necessity remove to some other Country. If this extraordinary Event should take place, there would be an end of the Bounties granted by Act of Parliament for the Encouragement of our Fisheries, and so much to the advantage of the poor Fishermen; for this Act being for seven year only, three of which are expired, the same interest that procured such an Alteration in the Revenues, and applied them to the use of a private Individual, would no doubt prevent the Fishery-act from being revived and continued; consequently the bounties would soon be no more.

Now, Gentleman, are you not obliged to the Duke for all these attempts to affect your Liberties and Properties, and ought you not to thank him for his good wishes towards you, if you consider the Enjoyment of Liberty and Property a burden to you; and to blame the Keys for having stood in your way to Promotion? But, Gentlemen, as many of you as think so, are to consider, that the Duke has no Occasion to get you to sign Petitions to enable him to give you any thing : it is clear that he cannot take any thing from you without your consent; and therefore it is necessary for him to get you to sign Petitions, to consent to, and confirm certain things, before he can effectually accomplish his ends.---And I therefore again recommend it to you to stand your guard.","[44] y] — this word is struck through in the manuscript.
