Manx,English
"     Ayns jeeaghyn er e vea t’er ngholl shiaghey, as dooinney ve e eanish hene, as nagh vel cronnaghey dy vel eh er nyannoo nhee erbee ass y raad, teh feeu agan ghoaill jeh ! Cha vod eh dy bragh bishaghey ayns foays, as yiow eh baase lesh ooilliu e oiljyn er e chione.","In looking on his life that has passed, and a man being his own witness, and not detecting that he has done anything untoward, it’s worth bemoaning him! He can never increase in goodness, and he will die with all his faults on his head."
