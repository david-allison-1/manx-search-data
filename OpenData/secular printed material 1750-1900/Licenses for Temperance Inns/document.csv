","That anyone of ordinary understanding could know that the business of drink is evil, as it was bearing nothing good. If it was as good as some people think it is, how is it that town governments of the land are charged with the supervision of its consequences? Are peace officers requested to keep watch on the priests in their holy offices as they are on the pubs? Weren’t priests allowed to go as far as we liked in doing good? If a licence holder needs to be girded (restricted) by a law shouldn’t the public be the most suitable ones to set the limit of these obligations and to say what number and what place they need? If the residents of the neighbourhood of a place say that they don’t need an pub amongst them surely it isn’t fair for any group of men at all, no matter how powerful., to force them to accept a pub against their will. Let it be after the people to say if they a need of them. As far the subject concerns him (Mr Teare) he would ... all the dealings of the licensees in the ocean and he was believing that all the drunkards were the first folk that would ... their hands to help because there were no people who were as willing to see it weeded out as they were."
