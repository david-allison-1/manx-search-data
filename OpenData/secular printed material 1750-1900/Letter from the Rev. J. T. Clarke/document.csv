","       Although it is running fast to an end, like the other branches of the old native tongue which once held sway over the third part of France, nevertheless it is no wonder that they are all going down the hill (declining), but especially the Manx Gaelic, for there are so few inhabitants in the Island.

He has vessels, also, to go from country to country, even against the eye of the wind, the tides of the sea, and the gales of heaven.",

This is the principal reason why our Manx Gaelic has gone down so fast. The Isle of Man has now become, as it were, a part of England, where English is the common language of the people.",

The trade of the Island is brought within fire or six hours of the markets of England, and to trade there, English, and English only, they must have.",

","      At ten years of age I was able to speak fluently in Manx with my father’s tenants, who did not understand English, and before I was twenty years of age I had translated many little English books into Manx, and printed them for the use of the people. Now, with all this work in Manx, it was never in my way either when speaking or reading English.",

At last, by shouting and beating, he got them all in to their stall-halters, and he was at rest.","eiystyr—a halter, or cow-tie, in the nineteenth century cattle were often kept tied up in halters when inside barns."

But I have given their bones a good cracking, and let them take that for their supper.”",

","     It is Manx they all have at meetings with eachother, in their everyday trade, in showing the Word of God to the people, and almost everything else. At the same time, there are not any people  around about them who have any better English. There were two of them at my house some years ago. One of them was born in America, though of Manx father and mother. He was educated as a lawyer. The other was my own sister’s son, who went away in his youth to America, and when be left the Island he understood nothing but English. I wondered to hear the good Manx they had, and it did no harm to their English. They had two languages instead of one.","The original has treeayt, presumabley a typo for ‘keayrt’."

When we reached the top of the Howe, there was a place there where at some time the rocks were split and torn asunder in a very wonderful manner by an earthquake. The place was called the Scauryn (Chasms). There were several young boys there, about ten or a dozen years of age, cutting ling for fire.",Cregeeen gives skoryn.

I enquired again of the biggest boy of them in English, because of the stranger that sras with me, "" Had they lost their tongues in the ling ?"" I was no wiser than I was before.
