(Juan as Illiam meeiteil.),(Juan and Illiam meeiteil.),
"Illiam.—Wahll Yuan, kys t’ou goll er bwo? Vel oo rey rish y Heral? Vel oo er lhaih ny naightyn noa bentyn da’n Chiare-as-Feed?","Illiam.—Well Juan, how are you going on boy? Are you finished with the Herald? Have you read the latest news concerning the Keys?",
"Juan.—Cre ny naightyn t’ou meanal? Cha vel mish er vakin nhee erbee noaayn edyr, ga dy vel y pobble geearree dy beagh reamys oc reih yn Chiare-as-Feed. Dys shen t’eh ooilley çheet er-lhiam’s—c’red elley?","Juan.—Which news do you mean? I haven’t seen anything new, at all, although the people desire to have freedom to elect the Keys. That far I’m managing it all—what else?",
,,
"I.—Oh ta ny smoo na shen. Tarad nish taggloo jeh jannoo accan[1], cha nee da’n Ree, agh da’n Chiare-as-Feed ad hene, dy yannoo leigh dy bee ad maghey shoh reiht liorish sleih ny çheerey, as cha nee lioroo hene.","I.—Oh, there’s more than that. They are now talking of making a petition, not to the King, but to the Keys themselves, to make a law that they will be, from now on, elected by the people of the country, and not by themselves.","[1] accan—‘a complant’, in this case the intended word is more likely to be aghin—‘a petition’)."
J.—Ta’n irrin ayd. Yarrood mish.,J.—That’s the truth (you have). I forgot.,
,,
"I.—Ogh ghooinney, shoh eer bree as smuir y chooish. Ta mish shickyr jeh nagh vel un er hene jeh’n Chiare-as-Feed nagh jinnagh sideal lhien ’sy chooish, dy jinnagh shinyn agh jannoo nyn aghin huc hene hoshiaght, geearree ad dy yannoo leigh ad ve reiht ass y noa, er-nonney ad ve reiht liorish slane consent y çheer trooid-magh ny skeeraghyn. Son instans, fer son dagh skeerey as y chooid elley son ny baljynmargee. Cre t’ou gra rish shen?","I.— O, man, this is the very essence and marrow of the matter. I am sure of it, that there isn’t even one of the Keys that would side with us in the matter, if we would only make our petition to themselves first, requesting them to make a law of them being elected anew, or them to be elected by the full consent of the country throughout the parishes. For instance, one for each parish and the rest for the market towns. What do you say to that?",
"J.—Dy jarroo shynney lhiam’s mie yn resoon ayd; as ta mee dy jarroo credjal nagh vel wan[2] oc nagh jinnagh nyn laue dys y leigh, as myr shen settlal y chooish ec slap.","J.—Indeed, I well love your argument; and I do indeed believe there that there isn’t one of them that wouldn’t put their hand to (vote for) the law, and so settle the matter at a slap.",[2] wan—Anglo-Manx; ‘one’.
"I.—Boy veen cre’n yllagh veagh trooid yn ellan, scoltagh ad ny creggyn faggys lesh eam. Boy lah, cre’n boggey vees orrin y laa shen!","I.—Dear boy, what shouting there would be through the Island, they’d split the rocks nearly with shouting. Boy-lad, what joy would be upon us that day!",
"J.—Ta mish dy slane jerkal rish y laa shen, Illiam; as son yn oyr shoh.Inshym’s dhyt red foddee nagh row fys ayd’s er roie. Ta’n chooid smoo jeh’n Chiareas-Feed er e hon. Tar ad slane kiarit, ta mish toiggal, dy yannoo soiagh jeh accan huc liorish y theay, as gialdyn feaysley.","J.— I am fully anticipating[3] that day, Illiam; and for this reason. I’ll tell you a thing that maybe you didn’t know before. The majority of the Keys are in favour of it. They are fully determined, I understand, to make an acceptance of a complaint by the public, and promise a remedy.","[3] jerkal—In the Manx Bible the meaning is usually ‘expecting’, but in eighteenth century writing it is often used with the meaning ‘hoping’. Here it is taken to mean ‘anticipating’, other translators may disagree with this."
"I.—My t’eh dy feer myr shen, Yuan, cha voddagh Manninee red s’doaieagh y yannoo na çheet er nyn doshiaght, as cur y chied çhionse daue, as eisht heeagh sleih cre’n aght harragh ad er.","I.—If it is really like that, Juan, Manx people couldn’t do a more decent thing than come forward, and give them the first chance, and then people would see how they would come on (would go on / would progress).",
"J.—Veagh eh foddey sloo dy hrubbyl, as çheu-mooie jeh shen, veagh eh ny s’easal[4] y yannoo, as ooilley çheu-sthie jin hene. Veagh Manninee goll lesh-y-cheilley dys yn obbyr, as cha nee roostey nyn dhoin dys joarreeyn, as ginsh daue ayns Sostyn nagh voddagh shin jannoo n’egooish oc. Ayns Mannin veg veen ’sy traa t’ayn cha vel keesh orrin agh lheid as ta shin goaill soylley jeh. Ta keeshyn er ny queeylyn—wahll, ta raaidyn mie ain; ta keeshyn er ny moddee—wahll, ta droghadyn noa jeant; ta keeshyn er ny thieyn oast—as cooid lhisagh ve, son tar ad jannoo wite assee liorish miolagh shenn vlebbinyn as scollagyn litçheragh dy iu, as dy chur mow nyn saaseyn beaghee. Nish ta ooilley ny keeshyn shoh currit magh er ny raaidyn ain, as ta shin sauail liorish; son ta ny queeylyn, as ny cartyn, as ny greienyn, as ny crouyn cabbil ain ceau foddey sodjey dooin.","J.—It would be far less truble, and besides, it would be easier to do, and all internally to us. Manx people would co-operating with the  job, and not baring our bottoms to strangers and telling them in England that we couldn’t do without them. In dear little Mannin at the moment we aren’t taxed except such as we enjoy. There are taxes on wheels—well, we have good highways; there are taxes on the dogs—well, there are newly-built bridges; there are taxes on the pubs—and an amount that it should be, because they are causing so much harm by tempting old fools and lazy youths to drink, and wiping out their livelihoods. Now all these taxes are put out on our highways, and we are saving  be means of it; because our wheels, and carts, and machinery, and horseshoes wear far longer for us (last us far longer). ","[4] ny s’easal—‘easier’, standard Manx; ‘ny sassey’."
"I.—Ta ghooinney; as lurg ooilley, she yn Kiare-as-Feed ren y leigh hug ny keeshyn shoh orrin.","I.—Yes, man; and after all, it’s the Keys who made the law that put these taxes on us.",
"J.—Dy beagh lesh shen, dy beagh ad er n’yannoo dy chooilley nhee ren ad chammah’s shen, cha row oyr son plaiynt.","J.—If it were therein, if they had done everything they did as well as that, there wouldn’t be cause for complaint.",
"I.—Wahll, wahll, hee main. Lhig daue ve reiht liorish y theay, as eisht—","I.—. Well, well, we’ll see. Let them be elected by the public, and then—",
"J.—She, as eisht bee yn sleih cooilleenit. As my hig accan my raad’s laccal signal, verrym’s my laue huggey.","J.—Aye, and then the people will be fufilled. And if a complaint[5] comes my way wanting signing, I’ll put my hand to it. ","[5] accan—‘a complant’, in this case the intended word is more likely to be aghin—‘a petition’."
"I.—Verrym neesht. Oie vie, Juan.",I.—So will I (put my hand to it). Goodnight Juan.,
"J.—Oie vie ayd, Illiam.","J.—Good night to you, Illiam.",
