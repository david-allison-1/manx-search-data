"     Foddee dy jean shiu coontey myr red joarree mish dy screeu hiu, er yn oyr as nagh row mee cliaghtey screeu red erbee dy chur pabyr, ga dy vel ayrn er ve aym’s goaill yn phabyr eu son foddey dy hraa; as sheign dou goaill rish dy vel fys aym er lane reddyn liorish lhaih eh, nagh row rieau fys aym’s er roïe. Yn chooish va aym’s ayns laue va shoh,—Yn chay noa t’ad troggal ayns Laxey. ","     Perhaps you will consider it a strange thing that I am to write to you, for the reason that I’m not used to writing anything to send a paper, although I’ve took part in taking your paper for a long time; and I must say that I know about many things through reading it that I never had known before. The thing I had in hand was this - The new quay they’re building in Laxey. ",
"     Er lhiam dy lhisagh dy chooilley ghooiney streeu dy çheer eh er e hoshiaght, er lheh adsyn ta troailt yn keayn. ","     I think that each and every man should strive to cheer it on it on, especially those that travel the sea. ",
"     Er lhiam dy beagh eh sauçhys mooar da eeaysteyryn. Oddagh boayl-fastee ve ec ymmodee keayrtyn dy roie voish yn sterrym lesh geay neear, ny neear-'ass. Yn oie shen va’n Monarch caillit va mish ec y scaddan, as s’mooar yn beitteil va shin er scapail dy beagh shin er ve abyl roie gys Laxey.",     I think it would be a great safety for fishermen. They could have a place of shelter many a time to run to from a storm with a West or South-West wind. That night the Monarch was lost I was at the herring and it was a great beating we would have escaped if we had been able to rush to Laxey. ,
"     Ta’d goll er nyn doshiaght lajer lesh yn obbyr. Va mee heese er yn lhaghyn shoh, jeeaghyn er yn obbyr va’d jannoo, as er lhiam nagh vaik mee rieau lheid yn clabbin goll ayns obbyr erbee, son t’eh jeeaghyn dy jean eh shassoo magh ooilliu jeh’n sterrym hig noi. ","     They’re progressing strongly with the job. I was down upon it these days, watching the work they were doing, and I think that I have never seen such a drive going into any work, for it seems that it will resist all of the storm that will come against it. ",

"     Ta’n dooinney tarroogh shen, Captan Rowe, er chur e gheiltyn dys yn obbyr; as ta ny mineryn ta fo myrgeddin, greinnit liorish nyn maishtyr, er ghoaill taitnys ayns yn obbyr; as myr vees ny eeaysteyryn wishal son purt ayns Laxey, vow ny luggeryn ta goll geiyrt er ny boddyn[1] (vow) boayl-fastee dy roie ayn, ayns tra giare,—","     That industrious man, Captain Rowe, has put his shoulder to the task; and the miners that are under him too, encouraged by their boss, have enjoyed the work; and if fishermen wish for a port in Laxey, the luggers that go chasing the cod will get a sheltering place to rush into, in a short while, — ","•   [1] boddyn— translated as cod; BOD, s. pl. YN. a point, a bodkin ; hence the codfish is called boiddagh, quod vide. (Fockleyr Manninagh as Baarlagh, Kelly, J)"

"     —Cre dy jinnagh deiney ny luggeryn ta bentyn gys Ellan Vannin punt y baatey, cha beagh shen monney mooar as skillin as shey pingyn y dooinney, as yinnagh shen cooney mooar gys yn obbyr.

","     What if the men of the luggers who belong to the Isle of Man were to do a pound per boat, that wouldn’t be much more than a shilling and sixpence per man, and that would greatly help towards the work. I think, when the miners, of their own volition, without any claim at all for pay, have made such a start to the work that all the fishermen should be altogether with them towards the work. ",
"     Ta mish shenn Vanninagh, ta er ve troailt yn keayn son shenn bleayntyn, as ta mee fakin dy vel eh obbyr feer ymmyrçhagh. Ta mee er screeu ny lineyn shoh ayns yn ghlare ta mee oaylagh er; as my nee shiu cur ayns y phaber eh, nee shen pleasal screeudeyr.     ","     I am an old Manxman, that has traveled the sea for many years, and I see that the work is very necessary.  I have written these lines in the language I am familiar with, and if you put it in the paper, that will will please the writer.   ",
