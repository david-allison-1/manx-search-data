"     Cha sayms nee Robin, na Thom, na Juan, t’ort ; agh dy veeït mee rish yn ennym Robin Briw ’sy phaabyr, as dyn ennym elley; agh ta mee ourryssagh ny yeï dy vel shiu myr y chenn legion roish nish, as dy vel shiu ymmodee; son cheayll mee jiu roïe. Ta mee gooaill yindys cre ta jannoo ort, solla ta!","     I don’t know if you’re called Robin, or Thom, or Juan; except that I met the name Robin Briw in the paper, and no other name; but I am nevertheless suspicious that you are like the ancient legion before, and that you are many, for I heard of you before. I’m wondering what’s up with you, so I am! "

Nee dy chur lesh gailck reesht er e toshiaght, as myr shen dooney magh schleï, as soiljey as tushtey veih Manninee?","     I was a hundred percent made up in my mind to speak to you before now, but I held myself back a while, expecting more idiocy from you. It seems now as if you had taken a break; but I suspect that you’ll be at work again, as soon as you get a chance. What would you wish? Is it to bring the Manx Language forward, and so close out art, and light, and learning from Manx people?"
"     Tou steetagh dy lioor, raad tou gra nagh vel oo shirrey liettal y vaarle,—ec y tra cheddin dy vel oo moylley gailck! Vel oo sheiltyn ayns dty chree, dy re blebbinyn sleih? Verryms fys dhyt er, nee blebbinyn Manninee, mannagh nee! ","     You’re sly enough, where you say that you aren’t looking to hold back English, - at the same time that you’re praising Manx! Do you imagine, in your heart (honestly), that people are simpletons? I’ll let you know, if Manx people are simpletons, or are not!"

Gow coyrle, leh, as bee feagh.","     I am a Manxman, you see, as well as you, but I would be ashamed to praise ignorance and poor learning to my countrymen. I love them far too well to mock them like that, to put such ravings in their heads, and besides that, mislead the growing young generation. I would wish for them to become like other countries – educated – and sharp, and clothed with art, whilst you, it seems, are for holding them down to their own familiar ways, so they won’t speak, for ages and ages, a speck of any language but Manx. Take advice, boy, and be quiet."
