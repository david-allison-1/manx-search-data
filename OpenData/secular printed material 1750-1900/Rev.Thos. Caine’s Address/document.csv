","     My friends and Country Men. I never expected to see such a large meeting as there is here tonight, having come together to hear Manx songs and conversation, and also the Word of God being read in the mother tongue of the Isle of Man. It is joyful to see such a sight. It proves that the Manx are willing to hear the language of their ancestors— time was, and it isn’t long ago, that is, within sixty years, when there was very little English spoken in this Island, outside of the market towns, and the Word preached in Manx in the parish churches two or three Sabbaths in the month.",
"Roish va ny scriptyryn er ny chaghlaa gys gaelck, va ny saggyrtyn lhaih shirveish ny keillagh veihn vaarle ayns gaelck, myr va’d jannoo yn shirveish.

Va shoh jessarn, daa laa lurg shen, veh bwoailt lesh palsy, myr shen, nagh loayr eh arragh, as shiaghtin lurg shen, phaayrt eh.","     Before the scriptures were translated into Manx, the priests were reading the church service from the English into Manx, as they were doing the service. When the scriptures were first translated into Manx, a portion each was given to each priest to do, and when they had completed the work, it was printed in three parts. The old testament in two parts and the new testament by itself, and when the final part that was printed came to Bishop Hildesley, he was so joyful about it, though he himself did not understand it, that he said, “Lord, now you permit your servant to depart (die) in peace, according to your word, for my eyes have seen your salvation” (Luke 2nd chap., 29th verse). This was Saturday, two days after that, he was struck with palsy, so, he never spoke again, and a week after that, he passed away. ",
"Te red feer yindyssagh, nagh vel yn gaelck goll-rish yn vaarle, son fer erbee ta toiggal as loayrt yn gaelck mie, te’h toiggal dy chooilley ockle jeh.

Cha vel feme ocsyn ta chlashtyn eh, er lioar fockleyr ny dictionary ve lioroo dy geddyn meanal ymmodee jeh ny fockleyn ta loayrit.","     It is a truly wonderful thing that Manx is not like English, for anyone who understands and speaks Manx well, he understands every word of it. And even the scriptures, that, in many places, expound  the meaning of the English. Those who hear it don’t need a dictionary to get the meaning of the words that are spoken. ",

(Jannoo ny Hostyllyn 2nd c., 1st – 16th v., 7c., 1st Corinthianee 14th c., 1st – 16th v.)","     On the day of the Pentecost, the gift of ‘tongues’ was given to the apostles, the first preachers of his word, so that they could proclaim  the good news of salvation to all those who were at Jerusalem at that time, for there were people at Jerusalem at that time from all parts. They all became amazingly afraid when they heard the apostles speaking to every man in his own native language. These (men) would go home to their own countries and tell their countrymen the wonderful things they had heard, so the good news of salvation was spread. (Jannoo ny Hostyllyn 2nd c., 1st – 16th v., 7c., 1st Corinthians 14th c., 1st – 16th v.)",[1] Sometimes in nineteenth century Manx—harragh ‘would come’ is used where ragh—‘would go’ is expected.

","     Owing to the many foreigners who come to the Isle of Man who speak English the people are forgetting Manx, so it is well to remember it, so that it won’t come down altogether. It used to be said in the Isle of Man, when anyone was going to Peel to live, “he’s giving up the world, and going to Peel,” but it isn’t like that now, because the people of Peel are setting an example for us, it would be good for us to follow it, that is; to keep up our own language, the language of our own ancestors. The Welsh keep up their language in a wonderful way, so they hear the Word preached every Sabbath, or very often, and they have to get Bishops who understand and speak in their own language. There are not many in this Island who do not understand English, although they don’t speak it very well, but these would prefer to hear the Word preached in Manx than in English, because they understand every word of it. There are some in my own parish who prefer me to speak to them and to pray with them in Manx that in English.","[2] The following note appeared in Mona’s Herald: “In the Rev Thomas Caine’s speech at the Manx Readings, the following omission was made immediately after lst Corinthienee, 14c, l-9v, after the word “Mannin,” and before the words “Cooinaghtyn jeh,” &c. : “Ta loayrt baarle ta’n sleih jarrood yn Gaelck, myr shen, dy vel eh mie ve currit, ayns cooinaghtyn,”  &c. Copies of the Herald, containing the report of the Readings, can still be had at our agents.” The missing words have been added here."

","     It would be good if we could revive the old language. It is thought that there are two hundred languages or more in the world, so those that are sent out to preach the gospel to the foreign nations learn the language of the people to whom they go, and translate the scriptures into that language, so that they may hear and read the Word in their own languages.

I hear that a Manx service is kept still in the Wesleyan Chapel in this town. When Reverend Brown went to Braddan Parish, although he was getting on in years at that time, he learnt Manx, and in a short while he was able to read and preach in the mother tongue of the Isle of Man. And the further he progressed, the further he enjoyed it. Although he understood Hebrew, Greek and Latin, Manx was of more use for those he was preaching to, because they understood him. It won’t do for me me to take up any more of the meeting’s time, for there is a large company of people coming after me, to read and to sing and to make music.",
