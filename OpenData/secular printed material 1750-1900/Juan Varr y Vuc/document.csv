JUAN VARR Y VUC.,JACK WHO KILLED THE PIG.,
     Keayrt dy row va ben voght vagh ayns glion ersooyl veih’n raad mooar er y çheu hiar Slieau-ny-Freoghane.[1] ,     There was once a poor woman who lived in a secluded glen on the eastern side of Slieau-ny-Farrane. ,[1] ayns glion ersooyl veih’n raad mooar er y çheu hiar Slieau-ny-Freoghane] ‘in a glen away from the highway on the east side of Slieau-ny-Freoghane’.
"Va e dooinney ny eeasteyr, va dy-mennick ersooyl veih’n thie rish foddey.","Her husband was a fisherman, who was frequently absent from home for long periods.",
"Ve er y ven, shen-y-fa, cha nee ynrican dy hendeil rish kiartaghyn y thie, agh; dy yeeaghyn mysh ny paitchyn chammah, myr-shen foddee oo ve shickyr va ny guillyn faagit dy yannoo mooarane myr bailleu.","The wife had, consequently, not only to attend to domestic matters, but to see after the children as well, so you may be sure the boys were left to do much as they pleased",
"     Va’n fer shinney jeu, Juan, gaase ny stuggey, va kinjagh streeu dy yannoo deedje ny obbyr croutagh.[2]","     The eldest of them, Juan, was growing into a stout lad, who was always trying to do some great feat or other.",[2] deedje ny obbyr croutagh] ‘a deed or crafty work’. [deedje] appears to be derived from ‘deed’ and is not attested elsewhere.
"Shimmmey ny caggaghyn v’echeysyn as y çhenn kellagh-guiy, dy akin quoi lhisagh ve mainshter.",Many were the battles that he and the old gander had to see who should be the master.,
"     Myr v’eh gaase ny s’moo ghow eh toshiaght dy yannoo caggey er yn ollagh, myr-shen tra honnick ad çheet eh streeu ad dy gheddyn magh ass y raad jeh’n vad vooar vechey. ","     As he grew bigger he extended his attacks to the cattle, so that when they saw him coming they endeavoured to get out of the way of the big stick he always carried with him.",
"Hroid e ayr rish ayns fardalys, tra haink eh thie veih’n eeastagh er oie Yesarn, agh ynrican haink eh dy ve ny s’daaney.","In vain did his father scold him, when he came home from fishing on a Saturday night, for he only became the more daring.",
"     Fy-yerrey ghow eh toshiaght dy woailley ooilley, by-cummey lesh row eh dooinney ny baagh, dy raink eh-ny-whail ayns ny ardjyn shen, as haink eh dy ve lheid y fer-agglagh dy der ad yn ennym “Juan y Marooder Foawr.”","     At last he began to use his stick on all, whether man or beast, that he met in those parts, and he became such a terror that they gave him the name of Jack the Giant Killer.",
"Haink e niart vooar dy ve cha baghtal dy raink ymmodee veih lhiattee Laxey dy chaggey lesh, agh hooar eh kinjagh y varriaght.","His great strength became so notorious that many came from Laxey side to try conclusions with him, but they were always worsted.",
"     Va kinjagh palçhey dy phurryn echey cour e henn voir, va’d mucyn feïe va feddynit ayns ny sleityn roie nish.","     He kept his old mother well supplied with purrs, as they called the wild swine that were formerly found in the mountains.",
"     Nish, va shen collagh-purr ayn enmyssit y Purr Mooar, t’er ve rish foddey red atçhimagh ’sy voayl shen, va lheid yn aggle er dy-chooilley pheiagh nagh row eh smooinit sauçhey dy gholl ny lomarcan harrish yn Reeast, as trooid Dayll-y-Druaight.","     Now, there was an old boar purr, called the Purr Mooar, that had long been a terror to the district, so much so that it was not considered safe for any one to go alone over the Rheast, and through Druidale.",
Eer ny bochillyn lesh nyn moddee nagh nh'are lhieu eh y veeiteil.,Even the shepherds with their dogs were unwilling to face him.,
"Va Juan kiarit y purr shoh y varroo, myr-shoh d’arm eh eh-hene lesh y vad s’moo v’echey, as hie eh magh eh y hirrey.","This purr Jack determined to kill, so he armed himself with his thickest stick, and set out in search of him.",
"     Lurg da er ve troailtagh raad foddey, hie eh sheese ayns glion dowin, ny-hrooid va’n ushtey tuittym ny-vud ny creggyn fo’n Chrammag, raad ren eh feddyn y collagh-muickey, soailçhaghey eh-hene ’syn ushtey, myr va laa breenagh ayn.","     After travelling a considerable distance, he made his way down to a deep glen, through which the water was tumbling amongst the rocks below the Crammag, where he discovered the boar, it being a sultry day, luxuriating in the water.",
"Myr leah’s honnick eh Juan hrog eh eh-hene seose, as, marish buirroogh agglagh, roie eh magh er.","No sooner did he see Jack than he raised himself up, and, with a terrible roar, rushed out upon him.",
"Ren Juan, dyn aggle erbee, coyrt bwoailley creoi er ny cassyn-hoshee echey, as huitt y purr harrish. Geddyn seose reesht, roie eh reesht ec Juan, hug eh er ymmodee bwoaillaglhyn dewil, agh by-vessey lesh Juan raip y purr lhott dowin ayns slheeast Yuan, ren eh foshlit gys y craue.","Jack, nothing daunted, received him with a severe blow upon the fore legs, which caused him to roll over. Getting up again, he rushed once more at Jack, who belabored him with many a heavy blow, but unfortunately the boar managed to inflict a deep wound in Jack’s thigh, which laid it bare to the bone.",
Sthill ren y caggey tannaght-derrey va ny-neesht bunnys goaill neeal trooid coayl-follagh[3] derrey ren Juan fy-yerrey lesh un bwoailley agglagh brishey kione y purr ayns peeshyn. as lhie y purr maroo ec e chassyn.,"Still the conflict went on till both were well-nigh exhausted and faint from loss of blood, till at last Jack with one terrible blow shattered the boar’s head, and laid him dead at his feet. ",[3] coayl follagh]  ‘loss of blood’ [coayl-folley] would be expected.

"     She lesh doilleeid mooar eh snaue Juan dy-valley, as cha laanee ny lhottyn echey rish foddey, son te grait dy row ad jeh dooghys pyshoonagh; as eer tra va’d slaanit echey, va ymmyrçh er dy gholl mygeayrt lesh cammag ooilley yn vea er-mayrn echey.","     It was with great difficulty that he managed to crawl home, and it was long before his wounds, which were said to be of a poisonous nature, healed, and, even when they were healed, he was obliged to go about with a crutch for the rest of his life.",
"Myr shoh va’n naboonys reaghit lesh daa red boiragh—Juan as y Purr Mooar—son va’n derrey yeh nish dyn-olk as y jeh elley marroo. Va’n caggey shoh freaylt ayns cooinaghtyn ayns y raa, “Varr Juan-y-Marrooder-Foawr y vuc ’syn awin” ","Thus was the neighbourhood rid of two troubles—Jack and the Purr Mooar—for the one was now harmless and the other dead. This feat was commemorated in the saying, “Jack the Giant Killer varr a vuc i.e.; killed a pig) in the river.” —",
