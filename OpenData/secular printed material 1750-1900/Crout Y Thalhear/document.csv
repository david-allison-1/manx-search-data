SKEEAL FIRRINAGH.,A TRUE STORY.,
"     Ayns ny shenn traaghyn, va sleih ny cheerey ayns Elian Vannin bollagh ve geddyn ny thalhearyn dy heet dys nyn dhieyn dy obbraghey. ","     In olden times, the country people in the Isle of Man used to engage the tailors to come to their houses to work. ",
"     Yn thalhear, choud as v’eh gobbraghey ec e cheird, as fakin caa mie son jannoo crout, tra va dy-chooilley pyagh magh ’sy vagher gobbraghey, huitt carrane ’sy phoht-broit va cloie dy reagh er y çhiollagh, as hooar eh-hene magh. ","     A tailor, whilst engaged at his occupation, and seeing a good opportunity to play a trick, when everbody was out in the fields working, dropped a carrane* in the broth-pot, which was merrily boiling on the fire, and made good his exit. ",
,* A sandal.,
"     Tra haink ben-y-thie ghennal dy hroggal y vroit, hrog ee y charrane ass va cribbit lesh broie, as v’eh jeeaghyn jee dy ve stheg dy eill-vart sooagh as aeg; hug ee kiongoyrt rish e mac ennoil tra haink eh stiagh dys jinnair. ","     When the genial old landlady came to lift the broth, she lifted out the carrane which, being shrunk with boiling, appeared to her to be a nice, tender, juicy piece of lean beef, which she placed before her beloved son when he came in to dinner.    ",
"     Tra ghow Juan toshiaght dy obbraghey urree lesh skynn as aall, va yindys mooar er, son ren eh feddyn magh nagh jargagh eh giarey y choyrt urree.     ","     When Juan commenced to operate upon it with his knife and fork, to his great surprise he found that he could not make any impression upon it. ",
"     “Feill-vart feer reen, vummig,” dooyrt eh.","     “Very tough beef, mammy,” said he.",
"     “A!” dooyrt y çhenn ven, “fuirree shiu derrey hig y glenneyder mooar stiagh, eeys eh leah ee.” (Va bun ec y fer-thie.)","     “Oh!” quoth the old dame, “wait till the Big Cleaner comes in (meaning the master of the house), he’ll soon eat it.” ",
