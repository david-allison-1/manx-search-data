Ta palchey breckyn[3] ayns yn awin. ","     I went from home early, and past Ballanard and Ballacreetch, and then past the smithy and the chapel, and across the field to Ballergey, and down the steps to the bridge below the school. Dear man, what a beautiful morning it was, the birds singing in the trees, and there was a blackbird making a sweet song on the top of a bush, and the water making a noise running over the stones. There are plenty of trout in the river. ","[1] sheese y greeishyn]  sheese ny greeishyn

[3] breckyn] ‘trouts’. Elswhere in the corpus the plural of breck ‘ trout’ is brick."

When I reached the wood under Eireyween I was very hungry. I had food in my pocket, and sat down and ate it sweet with a drop of water from the river.","[7] kin] cre’n
