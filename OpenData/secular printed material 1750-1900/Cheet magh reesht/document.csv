Te myrgeddin bentyn da foays dagh uennan:","I hear that you can come out again, Robin, and it is a cause of enjoyment for me, boy. I love reading your paper, for the reason that it gives true news, as well as being of use in various ways. It reminds the people in authority of their duties, and the officials of the obligation they are under to achieve justice. It is also concerned with everyone’s benefit."

Neen soiljey brishey magh ny vegannyn veihn vodjal dorraghey, as skeillee eh harrish sleityn as coanyn Vannin veg villish nyn ghree.","     You reappear like the sun with the morning sunbeam, although for a while you have been in the dark. The light will break out gradually from the dark cloud, and it will spread over the mountains and valleys of the sweet little Mannin of our hearts."
"     Mastey ymmodee scrieuderyn dty ainjys, smooinee mee dy derrins hood scrieuyn ayns Gialc.

I think Manx people should accept their own language, and show that which is their acceptance by sometimes making use of it in writing as well as conversation. Your paper is titled ‘That which brings knowledge to the Island’, some sign should therefore be visible by your countrymen that you are brotherly-minded towards them, and reveal that mindedness by the importance you make of every thing concerning them."

Sy tra tayn, aigh mie dy row lhiat!","     There are some of them, I know, that think a lot more of English, for the reason that gives more explanation in the things that concern news, and for art. But still, there aren’t many Manx people that don’t like the mother tongue (Manx). The Welsh publish papers in their national language. And how good it would have been for Little Mannin, if her language had never been moved to a corner (marginalised)! You understand me, I guess, and I will earnestly do my part so that you will, from now on, understand me even better—for I have a lot still to say—and you will hear from me again. For now, may you have good luck!"
