"MYR S’LEAÏE NEE OASTYSYN BOGHT GAASE BERCHAGH, S’LEAÏE NEE BLEBBINYN BERCHAGH GAASE BOGHT","THE FASTER THE POOR LICENSEES BECOME RICH, THE FASTER THE RICH FOOLS BECOME POOR",
,The fools have guzzled my brandy and wine—,
,"“Much good may it do them,” the cash is mine!",
"     Myr t’ou ayns slaynt vie as lajer ayns callin, cummal doaieagh as sheeoil ayd, kuse resoonagh d’arran, cuht braew d’eill dy chur ’sy phot, as sluight d’argid ro-laue, as my t’ou er n’aase skee jeh ooilley ny bannaghtyn shoh, goaill myr reih dy ve voght as dty vlebbin, ta aght ny gha ayn dy yannoo shen; agh insh-yms dhyt yn aght shickyree ’sy theihll er y hon,— Immee gys ny thieyn-oast as ynsee dy ghoaill y veshtyllys.","     If you are in good health and strong in body, have a decent and peaceful abode, a reasonable amount of bread, a fine cut of meat to put in the pot, and some ready cash, and if you have grown tired of all these blessings, taking by choice to be poor and a fool, there are many ways to do that; but I’ll tell you the surest way in the world for it,— Head to the pubs and learn to partake of the booze.",
"     My ta yeearree ayd dy gholl fo feeaghyn as dy chreeu[1] oo-hene; dy choayl dt’ ennym mie as dy ve fegooish un charrey firrinagh ’sy theihll, foddee ooilley shoh ve jeant er-y-chooyl lesh goll gys ny thieyn-oast as gynsagh dy ghoaill y veshtyllys.","     If you have a yearning to become indebted and ruin yourself; to lose your good name and to be without one true friend in the world, all this may be done right away by going to the pubs and learning to partake of the booze.",[1] dy chreeu—crieu—‘ruining’.
"     My t’ou goaill slane solley jeh shee as gerjagh firrinagh, as nish shirrey caghlaa dty stayd gys sou-aigney, brishey-cree, as deyrey cooinsheanse, eisht, immee-gys ny thieyn-oast as ynsee dy ghoaill y veshtyllys.","     If you are taking full enjoyment of peace and true comfort, and now looking to change your state to misery, heartbreak, and a condemnation of conscience, then head to the pubs and learn to partake of the booze.",
"     Ayns focklyn giarey; my t’ou geearree dy ve treih-hrimshagh ayns dy chooilley aght; dy cheau dty hraa ayns boghtynid, ayns aggle, as ayns torchagh choud as vees oo bio; dy gheddyn baase ayns mee-hreishteil, as dy gholl gys toyrt-mow dy bragh farraghtyn,— immee gys ny thieyn-oast as ynsee dy ghoaill y veshtyllys.","     In short; if you yearn to be miserably sad in every way; to spend your time in poverty, in fear and torture for as long as you live; to die in despair, and to go to an eternal destruction, — head to the pubs and learn to partake of the booze.",
"     Agh, fuirree-ort-oo, ta red ennagh sodjey ayn dy ghra rhyt:—","     But, wait, there is something further to say to you:—",
"     My ta yeearree erbee ayd ayns dty chree dy yannoo mie as haghney dagh olk; dy veaghey ayns shee rish Jee as deiney mie, as dy ve maynrey ayns traa as beaynid, guee dy feer jeean as creeoil gys yn Ooilley-niartal son pooar dy obbal oo-hene as niart dy hassoo noi dy chooilley violagh; freill ass ny thieyn-oast wheesh as oddys oo, son t’ad yn raad gys niurin, goll sheese gys shamyryn y vaaish, shimmey dooinney trean t’ad er stroie nagh lhig eer un vine hene “dy stoo erbee ta jeh bree dy chur lesh new-heeltys” stiagh er dty veillyn choud’s bio oo, “mannagh bee er oyr dy egin vooar.” Gow ymmodee kiarail nagh n’eayr oo da sampleyr gaueagh ny iuderyn shliawin shen ta graihagh er y vine beg, son te molteyrys mooar.  “Ny jeeagh uss er y feeyn ayns e yirgid, tra te soilshean ’sy chappan, tra te troggal e vree dy cooie. Ec y jerrey nee eh lhottey myr ard-nieu, as gaghey myr adder. Bee dty hooillyn soit er drogh-vraane, as nee dty chree fockley magh camlaagys.”","     If you have any desire in your heart to do good and avoid all evil; to live in peace with God and good men, and to be happy in time and in perpetuity, earnestly  and courageously beseech the Almighty for power to deny your yourself and might to stand against every temptation; keep out of the pubs as much as you can, because they are the way to Hell, going down to the chmabers of death, many’s the brave man they have destroyed, don’t let even one drop “of any stuff that is of essence to bring forth insobriety” past your lips whilst you live, “unless it be an emergency.” Take a lot of care that you don’t follow the dangerous example of those slippery drinkers who love the little drop, for it is a big deception. “Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.”",
"     Er-jerrey; mannagh nynney lhit’s yn choyrle shoh, gow dty raad hene cha leah as sailt, —ynsee dy gholl y veshtyllys, as cur SAILL er ny MRAANE-OAST[2]. “Agh toig uss son ooilley ny reddyn shoh, dy der Jee lesh oo gys briwnys.”","     To sum up; if you aren’t enamoured of this advice, go your own way as fast as you like,— learn to partake of the booze, and put GREASE on the PUB LANDLADIES*. “But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.”","[2] cur SAILL er ny MRAANE-OAST.—This phrase seems to be alluding to the saying ‘slaa saill er toinn muc roauyr’—‘daubing grease on a fat pig’s rump’, meaning ‘over-paying’, or perhaps ‘enriching someone beyond what is due’."
