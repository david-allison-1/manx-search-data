Do you think that it would be a good method for keeping the same bad teaching from taking sway amongst us, if a new law were to be made agreeing that a bishop, or priest, cannot, after those that are now continuing to enjoy a church living in the Island, at least be able to do the service nicely in Manx, as well as in English? If you are pleased to answer me in the Herald I will be very much grateful to you."
