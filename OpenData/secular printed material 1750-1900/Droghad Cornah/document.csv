","MY FRIEND,—I have not written to you since Dan and myself were up hunting at John’s house, and I did not see him until he came down for a sight on us the day before yesterday. He was at Douglas, he said, two or three weeks ago, and he heard there was some man at the Manks gathering in the Empire House, who told them that the cattle, the dogs, and every living thing people had, were at one time accustomed to the Manks tongue. ",

"     “Va”,  dooyrt dooinney elley, “as ny ushagyn v’adsyn kiaulley ayn jee neesht.” As va’n sheshaght ooilley garaghtee er shen. ","     “They were,” said another man, “and the birds, they sang their songs in it.” At that the whole company enjoyed a hearty laugh. ",
"     V’ad kiart dy-liooar, ny-yeih, son cha-row red erbee elley ocsyn dy ghra roo agh Gailck, as sheign daue toiggal ee.","     The two men were quite right, however, for the people had nothing else wherewith to speak to the creatures; therefore they had to understand it. ",
"      “Geayll oo yn kayt, Thomm?” dooyrt my ven rhym, tra va Juan ersooyl. “V’ee kiaulley carr Gailckagh ooilley’n tra va shin loayrt.” ","     “Did you hear the cat, Tom?” my wife said to me, when John had gone. “She was singing a Manks tune all the time we were talking.” ",
"     “O, foddee dy-row,” dooyrt mish. “Cha-nel shen yndys erbee. Vel fys ayd er skeeal y mwyllar Vallure, Phaaie?” ","     “Oh, indeed, perhaps she was,” I said. “That is not a great wonder. Do you remember the story about the miller of Ballure, Margaret?”",
"     “Cre’n aght t’eh goll nish. T'eh jarroodit aymys, ta mee credjal” ",      “I believe I have forgotten it. How does it go now?” ,
"     “Wall, va mwyllar er Vallure as ve’h agglagh son goll er meshtey, ayns wheesh dy row feallagh gra keayrt-ny-ghaa ‘Jeeagh er y mwyllar te’h scoorit reesht!’”       ","     “Well, there was at one time a miller on Ballure, who was so often on the spree that many a time people would be saying  ‘Look at the miller; he's drunk again!’”",
"     “Keayrt va eh-hene as fer elley er y scoor ayns thie oast, as dooyrt eshyn rish: ‘Ta’n eirrinee Skeeyl-y-Mahll gra dy vel ushag jannoo arrane ort heose ec y vwyllyn.’ As haink corree er. ","     “One time himself and another fellow were on the spree in a public house, and the other fellow said to him: ‘The Kirk Maughold farmers are saying that there is a bird singing a song on thee up at the mill.’ And he became very angry. ",
"      “Hie eh thie leah, lane go’rish roïe, as tra rosh eh dys y droghad lhie eh er y chleiy as huitt cadley er.

When he awoke, he heard a bird singing on the top of the big tree which grew behind the mill. ‘Listen,’ he said to himself, ‘what is she saying?’”",
