Manx,English,Original Version

Yn Undaagagh,The Nettle,The Nettle.
"Loaght dy meeley yn undaagagh, ","Handle the nettle gently,",Tender-handed press the nettle. 
Nee ee gaghey oo dy geyre; ,"It will sharply sting you,",And it stings you for your pains; 
"Eer myr shen lesh sleih condaagagh, ","It is just like that with difficult people,","Press it like a man of mettle, "
"My tou meiygh roo erskyn cair,","If you are gentle to them beyond what is right,",And it soft as silk remains. 
"Dell dy croie rish guillyn garroo, ","Deal harshly with rough boys,",So it is with vulgar natures : 
Nee ad loobey dys dty ghoo; ,They will bend to your word;,"Treat them kindly, they repel; "
"Jeeagh dy meen as gennal orroo, ","Look at then tamely and cheerful,","Use them rough, like nutmeg graters, "
As cha vod oo dellal roo.,And you won’t be able to deal with them.,And the rogues will use you well.
