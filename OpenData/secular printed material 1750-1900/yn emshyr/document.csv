Saalin y tra ta er jeet orrrin — smie son slaiynt — as smie son soylleyn vea; as cre cha booisal as lhisagh sleih y ve ec curmyner yn ghrian sollys jannoo cha boggoil jeh dagh nhee heihlt lesh y ghoullyn gerjoil!,"How beautiful is the time that comes upon us — so good for health — so good for the pleasures of life, and how thankfully people should be observing the bright sun making each worldly thing joyful with its comforting rays! "
Agh beggan tan wooise ta dy cadjin ennit as soiljit son ny toyrtyssyn bannee ta deiney dy ghoaill soylley jeu. Er dy chooilliu heu yiow main y vunnys aarloo dy hrughanys as dy phlaiynt.,     But little is the thanks generally felt and shown for the blessed gifts that men enjoy. On every side we will find the vast majority ready for grumbling and to complain. 
"Jir ad dy vel “rour chyrmagh — dy vel y faiyr shymley — ny messyn ayns gaue ve cummit, son laccal y druight ta gientyn messoilys; dy vel ny cretooryn gaueagh goll neeal — as nagh vel caslys dy bee palchey.”","     They’ll say that there is “too much drying — that the grass is withering — the fruit in danger of being stalled, for lack of the dew that generates fruitfulness; that the animals are  perilious of fainting – and there’s no sign that there’ll be plenty.”"
"     She, shohn ryd ta marvaanee ny hooirey kinjagh shegin er — yn phalchey.","     Yes, this is what the mortals of the earth always chase after — abundance."
"     Agh eshyn ghow shin ass brein nyn maarey, as ta dy nyn gummal seose er dyn tra ruggyr shin, as dys nyn ghione lheeah - as eer dys oor y vaaish ta dy nyn ymmyrkey; ny lomarcan eckesyn ta fys, cre ta dys nyn voays.","     But he who took us from our mothers’ wombs, and has upheld us since when we were born, and until (we have) grey heads (our heads are grey) — and even up to the hour of death, carries us; only he knows what is good for us."
"     Dasyn er_y fa_shen lhisagh shin fagail dagh nhee — son eshyn yn ayr ain ooilliu — shinyn e chloan, as eckey share ta fys cre share dooin. As my teh ny cheayrtyn fagin eh mie dy reayll vondeishyn beggey voin, sheign dooin ny_yeï goail rish dy vel ain nastee foddey erskyn nyn doilliu.","     To him therefore, that we should leave everythying – for he is the father of us all — we are his children, and he knows best what is best for us. And if he sometimes sees it good to keep little advantages from us, we must nevertheless admit that we have, for free, far beyond what we deserve."
"     Liorish e liettys jeh nyn meean teh gynsagh shin — liorish cur orrin gennaghtyn nagh vod main veg y yannoo jin hene, — teh dy chur shin ayns cooinaghtyn dy re veihsyn ta dagh nhee; as myr shen teh geginagh shin dy yeeaghyn seose, as dy chur nyn marrant ynrican er e feoltys. My ghowys mayd ain hene y chooish ayns eer aght resoon, yiow main dy vel y seihll reillt, lurg ooilliu, foddey share na oddagh shinyn reill eh, ga dy beagh ain nyn aigney","      By his prevention of our wishes he instructs us — by making us feel that we cannot make anything of ourselves, he reminds us that each thing is from him; and so he urges us to look up, and to trust only in his generosity. If we accept for ourselves the matter merely as reason, we will find that the world is ruled, after all, far better than we could rule it, even if were to have the will. "

"     Son dy beagh eh ain, cre yinnagh shin? Lhig da dagh irrinagh reï emshyr erlheh da hene. Lhig da fliaghey y chur lesh neose er e faiyr, as er e vagher foaghanagh. Ta fer jeeragh son thuilley — da fer elley, eckey ta giareeyn as lheeantyn, ta chiass ny greiney na svondeishee. Ec yn un oor jehn laa ta ooilliu shoh dy ve jeant. Cren sorch dy heihll veagh ain?","     Because, if we had it, what would we do? Allow each farmer to arrange the weather for himself. Let him bring down rain upon his grass, and on his sprouting field. One is straight for a flood – for another, who has areas of water-logged land and meadows, the heat of the sun is more advantageous. At the same hour of the day all of this is to be done. What sort of world would we have?"
"     Tan tragh travuïnn, — son eic shoh ta çhiass ny grêiney mie. Tan ghrian as y chiass eisht freillt, cour ny magheryn shen erlheh; er son yn arroo as ny glassereeyn elley, tan fliaghey mie. Cren aer veagh ain — cre ny goullyn-twoaie! Thuillaghyn ayns un ynnyd, tuittym veihn vodjal dullyr — chiass as sollyssid ayns ynnyd elley!","     The hay is ripe to be reaped – for this the heat of the sun is good. The sun and the heat thus kept especially for those fields; (but) for the corn and the other green crops, the rain is good. What a sky we would have – what rainbows! Floods in one place, falling from the black clouds – heat and brightness in another place!"
"     Ec yn un oor, syn un laa, nyn shassoo er mullagh shlieau, heeagh shin whilleen caghlaa bodjal, as whilleen shilley neuchadjin as verragh nyn dappey voin. Agh faag main y thalloo, as ver mayd shilley er yn aarkey. Whilleen baatey, as ny shlee na ta ardjyn y chumbaase, ta daayeig-as-feed ayns earoo. Ta dagh unnane oc shirrey goaill coors erlheh; as er_y fa shen, ta feme caghlaaghyn geay dy heidey. Nagh beagh ad er e cheilley? Cre’n chraagh veagh fud ny baateyn — cren scaalhean er ny lhongyn shiaulley dys whilleen ard er eaghtyr yn eaynagh vooar!","     At the same hour, in the same day, standing on a mountaintop, you’d see such a variety of cloud, and so many unusual sights it would drive us mad. But we will leave the land, and we’ll put a sight on the ocean. So many boats, and more in number than there are points of the compass, that are thirty-two in number. Each one of them looking to take a different course; and therefore, there is a need for various winds to blow. Wouldn’t they be on (stiking) each other? What destruction there would be amongst the boats – what a great scattering for the sailing ships to so many directions upon the surface of the great wilderness."
