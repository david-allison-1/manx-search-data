A volume of twenty-two translations of Bishop Wilson’s sermons was printed at Bath in 1783. The title page has Lioar 1, but it seems that only one volume was published. An additional thirteen unbound printed sermons have recently come to light, apparently proofs for a second volume.  According to Cubbon (1939: 798), the translator was Thomas Corlett (vicar of Lezayre 1773– 1803), but in a letter to Philip Moore dated 18 April 1781 and printed in Wilson's Works (vol. 1, 2nd edn: xix–xx), Henry Corlett (vicar of German 1761–1801) states that he is presently engaged in translating some of Wilson’s sermons and hopes to see them published ‘for the use of such of my countrymen as scarcely understand any other language but their own’. It thus seems clear that Henry, rather than Thomas, Corlett was responsible for at least some, and probably all, of the extant printed translations. As Cubbon recounts, '[t]he volume was printed at the expense of the son of Bishop Wilson, Dr Thomas Wilson of London, in honour of the Bishop’s memory’. There are four volumes of Wilson’s sermons in English; the Manx volume is a selection from the first three English volumes. The English sermons were also printed in volume 2 of Works of ... Thomas Wilson, printed in 1781, and it is this text which is reproduced here. (Thomas Wilson Manx Sermons 1–12 edited by Christopher Lewin and Max W. Wheeler August 2017). The first 6 translated sermons have the same numbering as the Engish. Thereafter they differ and the numbers from each publication are used in the respective sermon titles.
