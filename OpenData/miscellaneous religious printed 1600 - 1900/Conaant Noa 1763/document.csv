"The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.","Lioar Sheeloghe Yeesey Creest, mac Ghavid, mac Abraham.",
2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;,"Hooar Abraham Isaac, as hooar Isaac Jacob, as hooar Jacob Judas as e vraaraghyn.",
3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram,"As hooar Judas Phares as Zarah rish Thamar, as hooar Phares Esrom, as hooar Esrom Aram.",
4 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;,"As hooar Aram Aminadab, as hooar Aminadab Naassoon, as hooar Naassoon Salmon.",
5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;,"As hooar Salmon Booz rish Rachab, as hooar Booz Obed rish Ruth, as hooar Obed Jesse.",
6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;,"As hooar Jesse David yn ree, as hooar David yn ree Solomon ree-ish v’er ny ve ben Urias.",
7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;,"As hooar Solomon Roboam, as hooar Roboam Abia, as hooar Abia Asa.",
8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;,"As hooar Asa Josaphat, as hooar Josaphat Joram, as hooar Joram Ozias.",
9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;,"As hooar Ozias Joatham, as hooar Joatham Achaz, as hooar Achaz Ezekias.",
10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;,"As hooar Ezekias Manasses, as hooar Manasses Amon, as hooar Amon Josias.",
"11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:","As hooar Josias Jechonias as e vraaraghyn, mygeayrt y tra v’ad goit ersooyl nyn gappeeyn gys Babylon.",
"12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;","As ayns earish yn chappeeys ayns Babylon, hooar Jechonias Salathiel, as hooar Salathiel Zorobabel.",
13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;,"As hooar Zorobabel Abiud, as hooar Abiud Eliakim, as hooar Eliakim Azor.",
14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;,"As hooar Azor Sadoc, as hooar Sadoc Achim, as hooar Achim Eliud.",
15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;,"As hooar Eliud Eleazar, as hooar Eleazar Matthan, as hooar Matthan Jacob.",
"16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.","As hooar Jacob Joseph sheshey Moirrey, jee rugg Yeesey, ta enmyssit Creest.",
17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.,"Myr shen ta ooilley ny sheeloghyn veih Abraham gys David, kiare sheeloghyn jeig: as veih David derrey’n chappeeys ayns Babylon, kiare sheeloghyn jeig: as veih’n chappeeys ayns Babylon derrey Creest, kiare sheeloghyn jeig.",
"18 ¶Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost."," Nish va cheet er y theihll Yeesey Creest er yn aght shoh: Erreish da e voir Moirrey ve nasht rish Joseph, roish my daink ad dy vaghey cooidjagh, [A 2] va liannoo er ny gheddyn dy ve ayn-jee jeh’n Spyrryd Noo.",
"19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.","As myr va Joseph e sheshey ny ghooinney cairagh, as liorish dy row Eh neu-wooiagh yn nearey eck y insh magh dy foshlit, ghow Eh ayns laue dy scarrey ree dy follit. ",
"20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.","Agh choud as va ny reddyn shoh ayns e smooinaghtyn, cur-my-ner, haink ainle y Chiarn huggey ayns ashlish, gra, Yoseph vac Ghavid, ny gow aggle Moirrey yn ven ayd y ghoaill: son shen t’er ny yentyn ayn-jee, te jeh’n Spyrryd Noo.",
"21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.","As ver ee mac son y theihll, as enmys-ee oo yn ennym echey Yeesey: son sauee Eh e phobble veih nyn beccaghyn.",
"22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,","(Nish va ooilley shoh jeant, dy voddagh shen ve cooilleenit va’n Chiarn er loayrt liorish y phadeyr, gra, ",
"23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.","Cur-my-ner, bee liannoo ec moidyn, as ver ee mac son y theihll, as nee ad Eh y enmys Emmanuel, ta shen dy ghra, Jee mârin).",
"24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:","Tra va Joseph eisht er n’irree veih cadley, ren Eh myr va ainle y Chiarn er n’oardaghey da, as ghow Eh thie e ven:",
25 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.,"As cha row veg echey dy yannoo ree, derrey hug ee e chied mac rugg jee son y theihll, as denmys eh yn ennym echey Yeesey.",
,CAB. II.,
"Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,","Nish lurg da Yeesey er ve ruggitt ayns Bethlehem dy Yudea, ayns laghyn ree Herod, cur-my-ner, haink deiney creeney veih’n shar gys Jerusalem,",
"2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.","Gra, Cre vel Ree ny Hewnyn t’er jeet er y theihll? son honnick shin y rollage echey ayns y shar, as ta shin er jeet dy chur ooashley da.",
"3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.","Tra cheayll ree Herod shoh, ve seaghnit, as ooilley Jerusalem marish.",
"4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.","As tra v’eh er jaglym cooidjagh ooilley ny ard-saggyrtyn as scruderyn y pobble, dênee Eh jeu, cre’n raad va Creest dy heet er y theihll.",
"5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,","As dooyrt adsyn rish, Ayns Bethlehem dy Yudea: son shoh myr te scruit liorish y phadeyr;",
"6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.","As uss Bethlehem ayns thalloo Yuda, cha nee oo sloo ta, mâstey prinsyn Yuda: son ass-yds hig Kiannoort nee reill my phobble Israel.",
"7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.","Eisht hug Herod fys dy follit er ny deiney creeney, as vrie Eh jeu dy imneagh cre’n tra va’n rollage er ny akin.",
"8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.","As hug Eh ad gys Bethlehem, gra, Immee-jee, as shir-jee magh dy kiarralagh son y liannoo aeg, as tra vees shiu er gheddyn Eh, tar-jee lesh fys hym’s, dy voddym’s cheet as ooashley chur da myrgeddin.",
"9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.","Tra va’n ree erreish loayrt, jimmee ad rymboo, as cur-my-ner, hie yn rollage honnick ad ayns y shar roue, derrey haink ee as hass ee harrish yn ynnyd raad va’n liannoo aeg. ",
"10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.","Tra honnick ad y rollage, v’ad lhieent lesh boggey er-skyn towse.",
"11 ¶And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh."," As tra v’ad er jeet stiagh ayns y thie, honnick ad y liannoo aeg marish Moirrey e voir, as huit ad sheese, as hug ad ooashley da: as tra v’ad er vosley ny tashtaghyn oc, heb ad da giootyn; airh, as frankincense, as myrrh.",
"12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.","As fakin dy row Jee er chur roue ayns ashlish, nagh row ad dy hyndaa gys Herod, jimmee ad gys nyn jeer hene raad elley.",
"13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.","As tra v’ad er gholl roue, cur-my-ner, haink ainle y Chiarn gys Joseph ayns ashlish, gra, Irree, as gow yn liannoo aeg as e voir, as gow er-chea gys Egypt, as fuirree ayns shen derrey verryms lhiam fys hood: son shirree Herod y liannoo aeg dy stroie Eh.",
"14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:","Tra v’eh er n’irree, ghow Eh yn liannoo aeg as e voir ayns yn oie, as hie Eh roish gys Egypt:",
"15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.","As v’eh ayns shen derrey baase Herod: dy voddagh shen ve cooilleenit va’n Chiarn er loayrt liorish y phadeyr, gra, Magh ass Egypt deïe mee er my vac. ",
"16 ¶Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men."," Tra honnick Herod eisht dy row Eh mollit liorish ny deiney creeney, v’eh feer jymmoosagh, as hug Eh magh saarey, as varr Eh ooilley yn chloan v’ayns Bethlehem, as ayns ooilley ny ardjyn shen, veih daa vleïn dy eash as fo, cordail rish y traa v’eh dy imneagh er vriaght jeh ny deiney creeney.",
"17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,","Shen y traa va cooilleenit ny va loayrit liorish Jeremy yn phadeyr, gra,",
"18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.","Ayns Rama va coraa er ny chlashtyn, ullaghey as keaney, as dobberan mooar, Rachel keaney son e cloan, as gobbal dy ve er ny gherjaghey, er-yn-oyr nagh row ad er-mayrn.",
"19 ¶But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,"," Agh tra va Herod marroo, cur-my-ner, haink ainle y Chiarn ayns ashlish gys Joseph ayns Egypt,",
"20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.","Gra, Irree, as gow yn liannoo aeg as e voir, as gow gys thalloo Israel: son t’adsyn marroo va shirrey bioys y liannoo.",
"21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.","As dirree Eh, as ghow Eh yn liannoo as e voir, as haink Eh gys thalloo Israel.",
"22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:","Agh tra cheayll Eh dy nee Archelaus va reill ayns Judea, ayns ynnyd e ayr Herod, va aggle er dy gholl ayns shen, agh hyndaa Eh, myr va Jee er chur roish ayns ashlish, gys ardjyn Ghalilee:",
"23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.","As haink Eh as ren Eh vaghey ayns ard-valley enmyssit Nazareth, dy voddagh ny va loayrit liorish ny phadeyryn ve cooilleenit, Bee Eh enmyssit ny Nazarene. ",
,CAB. III.,
"In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,","Ayns ny laghyn shen haink Ean Bashtey, preacheil ayns faasagh Yudea,",
"2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.","As gra, Gow-jee arrys: son ta reeriaght niau er-gerrey.",
"3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.","Son shoh Eh va loayrit jeh liorish y phadeyr Esaias, gra, Coraa fer geamagh ayns yn aasagh, Jean-jee aarloo raad y Chiarn, jean-jee ny cassanyn echey kiart.",
"4 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.","As va ec Ean cheddin coamrey dy chlooie chamel, as cryss liare mysh ny meeghyn echey; as va e veaghey locustyn as mill feïe.",
"5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,","Eisht hie magh huggey Jerusalem as ooilley Judea, as ooilley’n cheer mygeayrt Jordan,",
"6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.","As v’ad er nyn mashtey liorish ayns Jordan, goaill-rish nyn beccaghyn.",
"7 ¶But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"," Agh tra honnick Eh ymmodee jeh ny Phariseeyn as ny Sadduceeyn cheet gys e vashtey, dooyrt Eh roo, O heeloghe dy ard-nieughyn, quoi t’er chur raaue diu dy hea veih yn chorree ta ry heet?",
8 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:,Ymmyrk-jee magh er-y-fa shen messyn cooie dy arrys.,
"9 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.","As ny smooinee-jee dy ghra cheu-sthie jiu hene, Ta Abraham ain son nyn ayr: son ta mee gra riu, dy vel Jee abyl jeh ny claghyn shoh, cloan y hroggal seose da Abraham.",
"10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.","As nish myrgeddin ta’n teigh er ny choyrt gys fraue ny miljyn: shen-y-fa ta dy chooilley villey nagh vel gymmyrkey magh mess mie, dy ve giarit sheese as tilgit ayns yn aile.",
"11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:","Ta mish dy jarroo bashtey shiu lesh ushtey gys arrys: agh ta eshyn ta cheet my yei, ny spooaral na mish, ny braagyn echey cha vel mee feeu dy ymmyrkey: bashtee eshyn shiu lesh y Spyrryd Noo as lesh aile.",
"12 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.","Ta’n chleayst echey ayns e laue, as nee Eh dy bollagh e laare-arroo y ghlenney, as gowee Eh e churnaght stiagh ayns y thie-tashtee: agh loshtee Eh yn choau lesh aile nagh vod v’er ny vooghey.",
"13 ¶Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him."," Eisht haink Yeesey veih Galilee gys Jordan gys Ean, dy ve er ny vashtey liorish.",
"14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?","Agh loayr Ean noi, gra, Ta feme ayms er ve bashtit liorts, as vel uss er-jeet hyms?",
"15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.","Dreggyr Yeesey, as dooyrt Eh rish, Cur raad dou nish: son shoh myr te cooie dooin dy chooilley chairys y chooilleeney. Eisht lig Eh da.",
"16 16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:","As hie Yeesey, tra v’eh er ny vashtey, seose chelleeragh as yn ushtey: as cur-my-ner, va ny niaughyn er nyn vosley er e skyn, as honnick Eh Spyrryd Yee cheet neose myr calmane, as soie er.",
"17 17 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.","As cur-my-ner, coraa veih niau, gra, Shoh my Vac graihagh, jeh ta mee dy mooar soiaghey.",
,CAB. IV.,
Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.,"Eisht va Yeesey er ny leeideil liorish spyrryd Yee gys yn aasagh, dy v’er ny violaghey liorish y drogh-spyrryd.",
"2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.",As tra v’eh er drostey da-eed laa as da-eed oie v’eh ny lurg shen accryssagh.,
"3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.","As haink y miolyder huggey, gra, My she Mac Yee oo, cur saarey da ny claghyn shoh dy ve jeant nyn arran.",
"4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.","Agh dreggyr eshyn, gra, Te scruit, Cha nee er arran ny lomarcan nee dooinney beaghey, agh liorish cre-erbee ta cheet magh ass beeal Yee.",
"5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,","Eisht hug y drogh-spyrryd lesh Eh gys yn ard-valley casherick, as hoie Eh Eh er eer-vullagh y chiamble,",
"6 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.","As dooyrt Eh rish, My she Mac Yee oo, tilg oo hene sheese: son te scruit, Ver Eh currym da e ainlyn my dty chione, as ayns nyn laueyn nee ad oo y ymmyrkey, er aggle ec traa erbee, dy bwoail oo dty chass noi clagh.",
"7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.","Dooyrt Yeesey rish, Te scruit reesht, Cha jean oo yn Chiarn dty Yee y violaghey.",
"8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;","Reesht hug y drogh-spyrryd lesh Eh seose er slieau feer ard, as yeeagh Eh da ooilley reeriaghtyn y theihll as y ghloyr oc:",
"9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.","As dooyrt Eh rish, Ooilley shoh verryms dhyt, my huittys oo sheese, as ooashley ’chur dou.",
"10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.","Eisht dooyrt Yeesey rish, Gow ass my enish, Noid-anmey: son te scruit, Ver oo ooashley da’n Chiarn dty Yee, as eshyn ny lomarcan nee oo y hirveish.",
"11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.","Eisht daag y drogh-spyrryd Eh, as cur-my-ner, haink ainlyn as ren ad Eh y hirveish.",
"12 ¶Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;"," Nish tra cheayll Yeesey dy row ad er ghoaill Ean, jimmee Eh roish gys Galilee.",
"13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:","As daag Eh Nazareth, as haink Eh dy vaghey ayns Capernaum, ta rish oirr ny marrey, ayns ardjyn Zabulon as Nephthalim:",
"14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,","Dy voddagh ve cooilleenit ny va loayrit liorish Esaias yn phadeyr, gra,",
"15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;","Thalloo Zabulon, as thalloo Nephthalim, er slyst ny marrey, cheu elley dy Yordan, Galilee jeh ny Ashoonyn:",
16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.,"Ta’n pobble va nyn soie ayns dorraghys, er vakin soilshey mooar: as dauesyn va nyn soie ayns cheer as scadoo’n vaish, ta soilshey er n’irree seose.",
"17 ¶From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."," Veih’n traa shen ren Yeesey toshiaght dy phreacheil, as dy ghra, Gow-jee arrys, son ta reeriaght niau er-gerrey. ",
"18 ¶And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers."," As honnick Yeesey, myr v’eh shooyl liorish keayn Ghalilee, da vraar, Simon, va enmyssit Peddyr, as Andreays e vraar, cur magh lieen ’sy cheayn: (son v’ad nyn Eeastairyn)",
"19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.","As dooyrt Eh roo, Eiyr-jee orryms, as nee’ms shiu nyn * Eeastairyn dy gheiney.",
,* Tayrnee shiu deiney gys Jee.,
"20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.","As chelleeragh daag ad nyn lieenteenyn, as deiyr ad er.",
"21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.","As tra v’eh er gholl veih shen, honnick Eh daa vraar elley, Jamys mac Zebedee, as Ean e vraar, ayns lhong marish Zebedee nyn ayr, karraghey ny lieenteenyn oc: as deïe Eh orroo.",
"22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.","As daag ad chelleeragh y lhong as nyn ayr, as deiyr ad er.",
"23 ¶And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people."," As hie Yeesey mygeayrt ooilley Galilee, gynsaghey ayns ny kialteenyn oc, as preacheil sushtal y reeriaght, as lheihys dy chooilley hingys, as dy chooilley ghoghan mastey’n pobble.",
"24 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.","As hie yn ennym echey magh trooid ooilley Syria: as hug ad lhieu huggey ooilley adsyn va fo aslaïntyn, adsyn va fo caghlaaghyn dy ghoghanyn as dy gheiaghyn, adsyn va drogh-spyrrydyn ayndoo, yn vooinjer va eddrym ayns nyn geeal rish caghlaa ny haist, as adsyn va’n chingys-cra orroo, as ren Eh ad y lheihys.",
"25 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.","As deiyr er chaglym mooar dy leih, veih Galilee, as Decapolis, as Jerusalem, as Judea, as veih cheu elley dy Yordan.",
,CAB. V.,
"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:","As fakin leid ny earrooyn dy leih, hie Eh seose er slieau: as tra v’eh er hoie sheese, haink huggey yn vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er. ",
"2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,","As doshil Eh e veeal, as dynsee Eh ad, gra,",

"11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.","Bannit ta shiuish tra vees shiu oltooanit, as tranlaasit, as dy chooilley ghrogh red er ny ghra nyn oi dy breagagh er y choontey ayms.",

"49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren ","As heeyn Eh magh e laue hucsyn va sheer geiyrt er, as dooyrt Eh, Cur-my-ner my voir, as my vrarraghyn [sic: vraaraghyn].",

"The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.","Yn laa cheddin hie Yeesey magh ass y thie, as hoie Eh sheese rish oirr ny marrey.",
"2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

"3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow; ","As loayr Eh ymmodee reddyn roo ayns coraaghyn-dorraghey, gra, Cur-my-ner, hie corryder magh dy chuirr.",
"4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: ","As myr v’eh cuirr, huit paart jeh’n rass rish oirr y raad, as haink ny eeanlee as die ad seose eh.",
"5 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: ","Huit paart ayns ynnydyn claghagh, raad nagh row cooid-vooar dy ooir echey: as chelleeragh daase eh, er-y-fa nagh row diunit thallooin echey:",
"6 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away. ","As ghow niart ny greïney yn soo ass, as er-yn-oyr nagh row eh er ghoaill fraue, hie eh naardey. ",
"7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them: ",As huit paart mastey drineyn: as daase ny drineyn seose as phloogh ad eh.,
"8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold. ","Agh huit cooid elley jeh ayns thalloo mie, as dymmyrk eh mess, paart keead-filley, paart three-feed-filley, as paart jeih fillaghyn as feed.",
"9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. ","Eshyn ta cleashyn echey dy chlashtyn, lig da clashtyn.",

"11 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given. ","Dreggyr eshyn as dooyrt Eh roo, Er-yn-oyr dy vel eh er ny choyrt diuish folliaghtyn reeriaght niau y hoiggal, agh dauesyn cha vel eh er ny choyrt.",

"18 ¶Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. "," Clasht-jee er-y-fa shen coraa-dorraghey yn chorryder.",
"19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.

"20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; ","Agh eshyn ghow yn rass ayns ynnydyn claghagh, yn fer ta clashtyn yn goo, as ayns y tullogh lesh boggey dy ghoaill eh: ",
"21 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.

"23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. ","Agh eshyn ghow yn rass ayns thalloo mie, yn fer ta clashtyn y goo as dy hoiggal eh, as t’eh tilgey mess as gymmyrkey, paart keead-filley, paart three-feed, as paart jeih fillaghyn as feed.",
"24 ¶Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: "," Coraa-dorraghey elley loayr Eh roo, gra, Ta reeriaght niau er ny hoyllaghey gys dooinney chuirr rass mie ayns e vagher:",
"25 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. ","Agh choud as va sleih nyn gadley, haink e noid as chuirr Eh coggyl mastey’n churnaght, as jimmee Eh roish.",
"26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. ","Agh tra va’n chass er n’aase, as er gholl my yeish, eisht haink y coggyl rish myrgeddin. ",
"27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? ","Er shen haink fir-vooinjerey yn far-thie, as dooyrt ad rish, Vainshtyr, nagh chuirr uss rass mie ayns dty vagher? cre woish eisht ta’n coggyl t’ayn?",
"28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? ","Dooyrt eshyn roo, Noid t’er n’yannoo shoh. Dooyrt ny fir-vooinjerey rish, Naiylt eisht shin dy gholl as dy heigh ass eh?",
"29 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. ","As dooyrt eshyn, Ny jean-jee; er aggle ayns teigh yn coggyl, dy dayrn shiu yn churnaght as ny fraueyn marish.",
"30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn. ","Lig-jee daue ny neesht gaase cooidjagh derrey’n fouyr: as ayns earish yn ouyr jir-yms rish ny beayneeyn, Chymsee-jee cooidjagh hoshiaght yn coggyl ayns bunneeyn ry hoi y lostey; agh chaglee-jee yn churnaght stiagh ayns my hoalt.",
"31 ¶Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: "," Coraa-dorraghey elley loayr Eh roo, gra, Ta reeriaght niau goll-rish greine dy rass mustard, ren dooinney y ghoaill as y chuirr ayns e vagher.",
"32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. ","As ga dy nee eh sloo jeh dy chooilley rass: foast tra te er n’aase, eh smoo ta mastey lossyreeyn, as te cheet dy ve ny villey; myr shen dy vel eeanlee’n aer cheet as goaill fastee ayns ny banglaneyn echey.",
"33 ¶Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. "," Coraa-dorraghey elley loayr Eh roo, Ta reeriaght niau goll-rish soorit ren ben y ghoaill as y ollaghey ayns three towesyn dy veinn, derrey ve ooilley soor.",
"34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them: ","Ooilley ny reddyn shoh loayr Yeesey rish y pobble ayns coraaghyn-dorraghey, as fegooish coraa-dorraghey, cha loayr Eh roo:",
"35 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world. ","Dy voddagh shen ve cooilleenit va loayrit liorish y phadeyr, gra, Foshlym my veeal dy loayrt coraaghyn-dorraghey, soilshee-ym magh reddyn t’er ve follit er dy hoshiaght y theihll.",
"36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. ","Eisht hug Yeesey yn cheshaght ersooyl, as hie Eh stiagh ayns y thie: as haink huggey adsyn va sheer marish, gra, Soilshee dooin coraa-dorraghey coggyl yn vagher.",
"37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; ","Dreggyr eshyn as dooyrt Eh roo, Eshyn chuirr yn rass mie, yn Mac dooinney:",
"38 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one; ",Yn magher y seihll: yn rass mie cloan y reeriaght: agh yn coggyl cloan y drogh-er:,
"39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels. ",Yn noid chuirr ad yn Jouyl: yn fouyr jerrey’n theihll: as ny beayneeyn ny ainlyn.,

"41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity; ","Ver yn Mac dooinney magh e ainlyn, as teighee ad ass e reeriaght dy chooilley nhee ta tayrn sleih gys peccah, as adsyn ta cur rish yn olk;",
"42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. ",As tilgee ad ad ayns coirrey ailagh: ayns shen vees keaney as snaggeraght feeacklyn.,
"43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear. ","Eisht nee yn chloan chairagh soilshean magh myr y ghrian, ayns reeriaght nyn Ayrey. Eshyn ta cleashyn echey dy chlashtyn, lig da clashtyn.",
"44 ¶Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.

"45 ¶Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: "," Reesht ta reeriaght niau goll-rish merchand va shirrey pearlyn mie: ",
"46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. ","As tra v’eh er gheddyn un phearl dy phrice vooar, hie Eh as chreck Eh ooilley ny v’echey, as chionnee Eh eh.",
"47 ¶Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: "," Reesht ta reeriaght niau goll-rish lieen va tilgit magh ’sy cheayn, as ghow jeh dy chooilley horch dy eeast.",
"48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. ","As tra ve laane, hayrn ad eh gys thalloo, as hoie ad sheese, as haue ad yn eeast mie ayns siyn, agh cheau ad yn drogh eeast ersooyl.",
"49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, ",Myr shen vees eh ec jerrey’n theihll: hig ny ainlyn magh as scarree ad y vee-chrauee veih mastey’n chloan chairagh;,

"51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord. ","Dooyrt Yeesey roo, Vel shiu er hoiggal ooilley ny reddyn shoh? Dooyrt adsyn rish, Ta shin, Hiarn.",
"52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old. ","Eisht dooyrt Eh roo, Shen-y-fa ta dy chooilley scrudere ta ynsit gys reeriaght niau, goll-rish dooinney ta ny ar-thie, ta cur magh ass y stoyr reddyn noa as shen.",

"54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, ","Ec y traa shen cheayll Herod yn Tetrarch jeh goo Yeesey,",

"26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear. ","As tra honnick adsyn va sheer marish Eh shooyl er y cheayn, v’ad seaghnit, gra, She scaan t’ayn; as v’ad ayns aggle, as deïe ad.",

"33 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.","Dooyrt adsyn rish, Hiarn, dy vod ny sooyllyn ain v’er nyn vosley.",

"And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,","As tra v’ad tayrn er-gerrey da Jerusalem, as dy row ad er jeet gys Bethphage, gys cronck ny Oliveyn, hug Yeesey jees jeusyn va kinjagh geiyrt er, er chaghteraght,",

"33 ¶Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:"," Eaisht-jee rish coraa-dorraghey elley: Va far-thie dy row ren garey-feeney y hoiaghey, as ren Eh cley y mysh, as chleigh Eh press-feeney ayn, as hrog Eh toor, as hoie Eh eh rish fir-hie, as hie Eh gys cheer foddey.",

"35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.","As ghow ny fir-hie e ir-mooinjerey [sic], as woail ad fer, as varr ad fer elley, as chlagh ad fer elley.",
"36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.",Reesht hug Eh magh sharvaantyn elley ny sliee na’n chied eallagh: as ghell ad roosyn er yn aght cheddin.,
"37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.","Agh er-jerrey ooilley hug Eh huc e vac, gra, Bee ad arrymagh da my vac.",
"38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.","Agh tra honnick ny fir-hie yn mac, dooyrt ad nyn mast’ oc hene, Shoh’n eirey, tar-jee, lig dooin Eh y varroo, as bee’n eiraght echey lhien hene.",
"39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.","As ghow ad Eh, as hilg ad Eh magh ass y gharey-feeney, as varr ad Eh.",
"40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?","Tra hig er-y-fa shen Chiarn y gharey-feeney, Cre nee Eh rish ny fir-hie shen?",
"41 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.","Dooyrt adsyn rish, stroie-ee Eh fegooish myghin ny drogh gheiney shen, as soie-ee Eh yn garey-feeney rish fir-hie elley, livrey-ys ny messyn da ayns nyn imbaghyn.",

,CAB. XXII.,
"And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,","As dreggyr Yeesey as loayr Eh roo reesht liorish coraaghyn-dorraghey, gra,",
"2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,","Ta reeriaght niau er ny hoyllaghey gys ree dy row, ren bannish son e vac,",
3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.,As hug Eh magh e harvaantyn dy eamagh orroosyn va cuirt gys y vannish: as cha bailliu cheet.,
"4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.","Reesht hug Eh magh sharvaantyn elley, gra, Abbyr-jee roosyn ta cuirt, Cur-my-ner, ta mee er n’aarlaghey my yinnair: ta my ghew as my veiyn beiyht marroo, as dy chooilley nhee aarloo; tar-jee gys y vannish.",
"5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:","Agh hoie adsyn beg jeh, as hie ad rymboo, fer gys e valley, as fer elley gys y dellal echey:",
"6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.","As ghow yn chooid elley ny sharvaantyn echey, as ghell ad dy roonagh roo, as varr ad ad.",
"7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.","Agh tra cheayll y ree jeh, v’eh jymmoosagh: as hug Eh magh e heshaghtyn-caggee, as stroie Eh ny dunveryn shen, as losht Eh yn ard-valley oc.",
"8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.","Eisht dooyrt Eh rish e harvaantyn, Ta’n vannish aarloo, agh y vooinjer va cuirt cha row ad feeu.",
"9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.","Gow-jee magh er-y-fa shen gys ny raadjyn mooarey, as whilleen as yiow shiu, cuir-jee gys y vannish.",
"10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.","As hie ny sharvaantyn shen magh gys ny raadjyn mooarey, as ren ad whilleen as haink nyn raad y haglym cooidjagh, chammah sie as mie: as va thie ny banshey er ny lhieeney lesh goaldee.",
"11 ¶And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:"," As tra haink y ree stiagh dy akin ny goaldee, honnick Eh dooinney ayns shen nagh row garmad-banshey er:",
"12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.","As dooyrt Eh rish, Charrey, kys haink uss stiagh ayns shoh, fegooish garmad-banshey? as cha row fockle echey dy ghra.",
"13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.","Eisht dooyrt y ree rish ny sharvaantyn, Kiangle-jee Eh laue as cass, as gow-jee Eh ersooyl, as tilg-jee Eh ayns y dorraghys sodjey mooie: ayns vees keaney as snaggeraght feeacklyn.",
"14 For many are called, but few are chosen.","Son ta ymmodee er nyn eam, agh beggan er nyn reih.",

"16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.","As hug ad magh huggey shiartance jeusyn v’ad hene er n’ynsaghey marish ny Herodianee, gra, Vainshtyr, ta fys ain dy vel oo firrinagh, as dy vel oo gynsaghey raad Yee ayns firrinys, cha-moo t’ow ayns imnea roish dooinney erbee: son cha vel oo soiaghey jeh persoon deiney.",

"18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?","Agh dennee Yeesey yn foalsaght oc, as dooyrt Eh, Cre’n-fa ta shiu shirrey dy my ghoaill ayns ribbeh, chrauee-oalsey?",

"20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?","As dooyrt Eh roo, Quoi gys ta’n jalloo as y screeu shoh bentyn?",
"21 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.","Dooyrt adsyn rish, gys Cesar.

"22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.","Tra cheayll ad shoh, ghow ad yindyss, as daag ad Eh, as hie ad rymboo.",
"23 ¶The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,"," Yn laa cheddin haink huggey ny Sadduceeyn, ta gra nagh vel irree-seose-reesht dy ve ayn, as dênee ad jeh,",

27 And last of all the woman died also.,As er-jerrey ooilley hooar y ven baase myrgeddin.,
28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.,"Shen-y-fa ec yn irree-reesht, quoi jeh’n chiaght vees ee echey son ben, son v’ee son ben daue ooilley.",

"36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?","Vainshtyr, cre yn ard anney ayns y leigh?",

"26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:","Dreggyr e hiarn, as dooyrt Eh rish, Harvaant vee-chairagh as neu-harroogh, va fys ayds dy row mish buinn raad nagh ren mee cuirr, as chaglym raad nagh ren mee skeayley:",

"And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,","As haink eh gy kione, tra va Yeesey erreish ooilley ny goan shoh y loayrt, dy dooyrt Eh roosyn va sheer geiyrt er,",

16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.,As veih’n traa shen v’eh shirrey caa dy vrah eh.,
"17 ¶Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?"," Nish er y chied laa jeh feailley yn arran millish, haink y vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er Yeesey huggey, as dooyrt ad rish, Cre’n raad sailt shin dy yannoo aarloo er dy [sic: dty] hon dy ee yn Eayn caisht?",

19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.,"As ren adsyn myr va Yeesey er n’oardaghey daue, as daarlee ad yn Eayn caisht.",
"20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.","Nish tra va’n fastyr er-jeet, hoie Eh sheese marish yn daa ostyl yeig.",
"21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.","As myr v’ad gee, dooyrt Eh, Dy firrinagh ta mee gra riu, dy jean annane eauish mish y vrah.",
"22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?","As v’ad feer trimshagh, as ren ad toshiaght dy chooilley annane oc dy ghra rish, Hiarn, nee orryms t’ow cheet? ",

24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.,"Ta’n Mac dooinney goll, myr te scruit jeh: agh smerg da’n dooinney shen liorish vees yn Mac dooinney er ny vrah: veagh eh er ny ve mie son y dooinney shen, mannagh beagh Eh jeet er y theihll.",
"25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.","Eisht dansoor Yuaase, ren y vrah Eh, as dooyrt Eh, Vainshtyr, nee mish Eh? Dooyrt eshyn rish, T’ow er ghra eh.",
"26 ¶And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body."," As myr v’ad gee, ghow Yeesey arran, as vannee Eh as vrish Eh eh, as hug Eh eh da ny ostyllyn, gra, Gow-jee, ee-jee, shoh my chorp’s.",

"28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.","Son shoh my uill’s jeh’n conaant noa, t’er ny gheayrtey son ymmodee son leih peccaghyn.",
"29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.","Agh ta mee gra riu, Nagh niu-ym maghey shoh jeh mess y villey-feeney, derrey’n laa iu-ym eh as yn noa mêriu ayns reeriaght my Ayrey.",
"30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.","As tra v’ad er ghoaill arrane spyrrydoil, hie ad magh gys cronck ny Oliveyn.",
"31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.","Eisht dooyrt Yeesey roo, Failee yn credjue eauish ooilley noght kyndagh rhym’s: son te scruit, Bwoaillym’s yn bochilley, as bee kirree yn chioltane er nyn skeayley.",

"36 ¶Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder."," Eisht haink Yeesey mâroo gys ynnyd va enmyssit Gethsemane, as dooyrt Eh rish ny ostyllyn, Soie-jee shiuish ayns shoh, choud as hem’s gys padjer ayns shid.",
"37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.","As ghow Eh marish Peddyr, as daa vac Zebedee, as ren Eh toshiaght dy ve trimshagh as trome-chreeagh.",
"38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.","Eisht dooyrt Eh roo, Ta my annym feer trimshagh, dy jarroo gys y baase: fuirree-jee ayns shoh as jean-jee watchal mârym.",
"39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.","As hie Eh red beg sodjey, as huit Eh sheese er e eddin, as ghow Eh padjer, as dooyrt Eh, O my Ayr, my te possible, lig da’n cappan shoh goll shiagh-ym: ny-yeih cha nee m’aigney’s, agh dt’aigneys dy row jeant.",

"41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.","Bee-jee er nyn dwoaie as guee-jee, nagh duit shiu ayns miolagh: ta’n spyrryd dy jarroo arryltagh, agh ta’n eill annoon.",
"42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.","Hie Eh roish reesht yn nah cheayrt, as ghow Eh padjer, gra, O my Ayr, mannagh vod y cappan shoh goll shiagh-ym, fegooish mee dy iu eh, dt’aigney's dy row jeant.",
43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.,As haink Eh as hooar Eh ad nyn gadley reesht: son va ny sooyllyn oc trome.,
"44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.","As daag Eh ad, as hie Eh roish reesht, as ghow Eh padjer yn tress cheayrt, gra ny goan cheddin.",
"45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.","Eisht haink Eh gys e ostyllyn, as dooyrt Eh roo, Caidle-jee nish, as gow-jee nyn vea; cur-my-ner, ta’n oor tayrn er-gerrey, as ta’n Mac dooinney er ny vrah gys laueyn peccee.",
"46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.","Irree-jee, as lig dooin goll: cur-my-ner, te eshyn er-gerrey dooin ta dy my vrah.",
"47 ¶And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people."," As choud as v’eh foast loayrt, cur-my-ner, haink Yuaase, fer jeh’n daa ostyl yeig, as va sheshaght vooar marish lesh cliwnyn as luirg, veih ny ard-saggyrtyn as shanstyr yn pobble.",
"48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.","Nish hug eshyn v’er vrah Eh, cowrey daue, gra, Quoi-erbee verrym’s paag da, shen Eh, cum-jee Eh dy shickyr.",
"49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.","As chelleeragh haink Eh gys Yeesey, as dooyrt Eh, Dy vannee dhyt Vainshtyr; as phaag Eh Eh.",
"50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.","As dooyrt Yeesey rish, Charrey, cre’n-fa t’ow er-jeet? Eisht haink ad as hug ad nyn laueyn er Yeesey, as ghow ad Eh.",
"51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.","As cur-my-ner, heeyn fer jeusyn va marish Yeesey magh e laue, as hayrn Eh e chliwe, as woail Eh fer-mooinjerey yn ard-saggyrt, as yiare Eh yn chleash jeh.",
"52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.","Eisht dooyrt Yeesey rish, Cur seose dty chliwe reesht ayns e ynnyd: son nee adsyn ooilley ta goaill y chliwe, cherraghtyn liorish y chliwe.",
"53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?","Vel uss goaill as laue nagh voddym’s nish guee gys my Ayr, as yinnagh Eh chelleeragh hym er-skyn daa legion jeig dy ainlyn?",
"54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?","Agh kys eisht vees ny scripturyn er nyn gooilleeney, dy nee shoh myr te dy ve?",
"55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.","Ayns yn oor cheddin dooyrt Yeesey rish y pobble, Vel shiu er-jeet magh myr noi maarlagh, lesh cliwnyn as luirg dy my ghoaill?

"56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.","Agh va ooilley shoh jeant, dy voddagh scripturyn ny phadeyryn ve cooilleenit. Eisht ren ooilley ny ostyllyn Eh y hreigeil as cosney rowe.",
"57 ¶And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled."," As leeid y vooinjer v’er ghoaill Yeesey Eh ersooyl gys Caiaphas yn ard-saggyrt, raad va ny scruderyn as y chanstyr er nyn jaglym cooidjagh.",
"58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.","Agh deiyr Peddyr er foddey ny yei, gys thie yn ard-saggyrt, as hie Eh stiagh, as hoie Eh marish ny sharvaantyn dy yeeaghyn cre veagh y jerrey.",
"59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;","Nish va ny ard-saggyrtyn as y chanstyr as ooilley’n choonceil, shirrey feanish foalsey noi Yeesey dy choyrt Eh gy baase.",
"60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,","Agh cha dooar ad veg: ga dy daink ymmodee feanishyn foalsey, foast cha dooar ad veg. Ec y jerrey haink daa eanish foalsey,",
"61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.","As dooyrt ad, T’eh shoh er ghra, Ta mish abyl chiamble Yee y lieggal, as y hroggal eh reesht ayns three laa.",
"62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?","As dirree yn ard-saggyrt seose, as dooyrt Eh rish, Nagh vel oo cur ansoor? Cre t’ad shoh dy hoilshaghey dt’oi? ",
"63 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.","Agh chum Yeesey e hengey. As dreggyr yn ard-saggyrt as dooyrt Eh rish, Ta mee cur currym ort liorish yn Jee bio, oo dy insh dooin, nee oo yn Creest Mac Yee?",
"64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.","Dooyrt Yeesey rish, T’ow uss er ghra eh: ny-yeih ta mish gra riu, Ny lurg shoh hee shiu yn Mac dooinney ny hoie er laue yesh yn phooar, as cheet ayns bodjallyn yn aer.",
"65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.","Eisht raip yn ard-saggyrt e eaddagh, gra, T’eh er loayrt goan mollaghtagh, cre’n feme sodjey t’ain er feanishyn? cur-my-ner, nish ta shiu er chlashtyn e ghoan mollaghtagh.",
"66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.","Cre ta shiu dy smooinaghtyn? Dansoor ad as dooyrt ad, T’eh toilchin dy ve er ny choyrt gy baase.",
"67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,","Eisht chew ad shellaghyn ayns e eddin, as woail ad Eh, as woail feallagh elley Eh lesh bassyn nyn laueyn.",
"68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?","Gra, Jean phadeyrys dooin, uss yn Creest, quoi ta dy dty woalley?",
"69 ¶Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee."," Nish va Peddyr ny hoie cheu-moie jeh’n cheshaght ayns y hall: as haink ben-aeg huggey, gra, V’ow uss myrgeddin marish Yeesey dy Ghalilee.",
"70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.","Agh dobb Eh kiongoyrt roo ooilley, gra, Cha s’aym cre t’ow dy ghra.",
"71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.","As tra v’eh er gholl magh ayns y phorch, honnick ben-aeg elley Eh, as dooyrt ee roosyn v’ayns shen, V’eh shoh myrgeddin marish Yeesey dy Nazareth.",
"72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.","As reesht dobb Eh lesh loo, Cha nione dou yn dooinney.",
"73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.","As tammylt ny lurg shen haink huggey yn vooinjer va nyn shassoo liorish, as dooyrt ad rish Peddyr, Shickyr she fer jeu oo, son ta dty ghlare dy dty vrah. ",
"74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.","Eisht ren Eh toshiaght dy ghweeaghyn as dy loo, gra, Cha nione dou yn dooinney. As chelleeragh gherr yn kellagh. ",
"75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.","As chooinee Peddyr er ny goan va Yeesey er ghra rish, Roish my gerr y kellagh, obbee uss mish three keayrtyn. As hie Eh magh as cheayn eh dy sharroo.",

"When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:","Tra va’n moghrey er-jeet, hug ooilley ny ard-saggyrtyn as shanstyr yn pobble nyn goyrle dy cheilley, dy choyrt Eh gy baase.",
"2 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.","As erreish daue v’er chiangley Eh, leeid ad Eh ersooyl, as livrey ad Eh gys Pontius Pilate yn kiannoort.",
"3 ¶Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,"," Tra honnick eisht Yuaase ren y vrah Eh, dy row Eh er ny gheyrey, ghow Eh arrys, as hug Eh lesh reesht ny jeih peeshyn-as-feed dy argid gys ny ard-saggyrtyn as y chanstyr,",
"4 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.","Gra, Ta mee er n’yannoo peccah, ayns dy vel mee er vrah yn uill neu-chyndagh. As dooyrt adsyn, Cre ta shen dooinyn? jeeagh uss da shen.",
"5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.","As hilg Eh sheese ny peeshyn argid ayns y chiamble, as jimmee Eh roish, as hie Eh as ren Eh Eh hene y chroghey.",
"6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.","As ghow ny ard-saggyrtyn ny peeshyn argid as dooyrt ad, Cha vel eh lowal dy choyrt ad mastey tashtaghyn y chiamble, er-yn-oyr dy nee leagh foalley eh.",
"7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.","As ghow ad coyrle, as chionnee ad lhieu magher fer-ny-craie, dy oanluckey joarreeyn ayn.",
"8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.",Shen-y-fa va’n magher shen enmyssit magher foalley gys y laa t’ayn jiu.,
"9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;","(Shen y traa va cooilleenit ny va loayrit liorish Jeremy yn phadeyr, gra, As ghow ad ny jeih peeshyn as feed dy argid, yn phrice echyssyn v’er ny phriceil, Eh ren adsyn jeh cloan Israel y phriceil:",
"10 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me.","As hug ad ad son magher fer-ny-craie, myr va’n Chiarn er n’oardaghey dooys.)",
"11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.","As hass Yeesey kiongoyrt y chiannoort, as dênee yn kiannoort jeh, gra, Nee uss ree ny Hewnyn? As dooyrt Yeesey rish, T’ow uss dy ghra eh.",
"12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.","As tra v’eh er ny chassid liorish ny ard-saggyrtyn as y chanstyr, cha dug Eh ansoor erbee daue.",
"13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?","Eisht dooyrt Pilate rish, Nagh vel oo clashtyn cre whilleen red t’ad shoh dy hoilshaghey dt’oi? ",
14 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.,"As cha dug Eh un ockle dy ansoor da, ayns wheesh as dy ghow yn kiannoort yindyss mooar.",
"15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.",Nish ec y eailley shen va’n kiannoort cliaghtey feaysley daue pryssoonagh erbee dy bailloo.,
"16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.",As va oc ec y traa shen ard phryssoonagh va enmyssit Barabbas.,
"17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?","Shen-y-fa tra v’ad er nyn jaglym cooidjagh, dooyrt Pilate roo, Quoi sailliu mee dy eaysley diu? Barabbas, ny Yeesey, ta enmyssit Creest?",
18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.,Son va fyss echey dy nee ayns goanlys v’ad er ny livrey Eh seose.,
"19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.","Tra v’eh erreish soie sheese er stoyl y vriwnys, hug e ven fys huggey, gra, Ny bee veg ayds dy yannoo rish y dooinney cairagh shen: son ta mish er hurranse ymmodee dy reddyn jiu ayns my chadley, kyndagh rish. ",
"20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.","Agh choyrlee ny ard-saggyrtyn as y chanstyr yn pobble ad dy yannoo aghin son Barabbas, as Yeesey y choyrt gy baase.",
"21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.","Dansoor y kiannoort as dooyrt Eh roo, Quoi jeh’n jees sailliu mee dy eaysley diu? Dooyrt adsyn, Barabbas.",
"22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.","Dooyrt Pilate roo, Cre nee’m eisht rish Yeesey, ta enmyssit Creest? Dooyrt ad ooilley rish, Lhig da v’er ny chrossey.",
"23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.","As dooyrt y kiannoort, Cre’n-oyr, cre t’eh er n’yannoo dy holk? Agh deïe adsyn ny smoo, gra, Lig da v’er ny chrossey.",
"24 ¶When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it."," Tra honnick Pilate nagh row geill er ny chur da, agh dy row ad aarloo dy irree magh, ghow Eh ushtey, as nee Eh e laueyn kiongoyrt rish y pobble, gra, Ta mish neu-chyndagh jeh fuill yn persoon cairagh shen, jeeagh-jee shiuish da.",
"25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.","Eisht dansoor ooilley’n pobble, gra, Yn uill echey dy row orrinyn, as er nyn gloan.",
"26 ¶Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified."," Eisht deaysle Eh Barabbas daue; as tra v’eh er chustey Yeesey, livrey Eh Eh dy ve er ny chrossey.",
"27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.","Eisht hug sidooryn y chiannoort lhieu Yeesey gys hall y vriwnys, as deïe ad er y slane sheshaght jeh ny sidooryn.",
"28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.","As rooisht ad Eh, as hug ad er coamrey scarleod.",
"29 ¶And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews"," As tra v’ad er fee attey dy ghrineyn, hug ad eh er y chione echey, as cuirtliagh ayns y laue yesh echey: as chroym ad nyn ghlioonyn kiongoyrt rish, as chraid ad mysh, gra, Dy vannee, Ree ny Hewnyn.",
"30 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.","As chew ad shellaghyn er, as ghow ad y chuirtliagh, as woail ad Eh er y chione.",
"31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.","As erreish daue v’er chraidey mysh, ghow ad yn coymrey reeoil jeh, as hug ad e gharmad hene er, as leeid ad Eh ersooyl dy chrossey Eh.",
"32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.","As myr haink ad magh, hooar ad dooinney jeh Cyrene, va enmyssit Simon: eshyn ren ad y eaginaghey dy ymmyrkey e chrosh.",
"33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,","As tra v’ad er jeet gys ynnyd ta enmyssit Golgotha, ta shen dy ghra, ynnyd bollag,",
"34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.","Hug ad da vinegar dy iu, as gall ny-chione: as tra v’eh er vlashtyn eh, cha ballish giu.",
"35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.","As ren ad Eh y chrossey, as reynn ad e gharmadyn, tilgey lottyn: dy voddagh shen ve cooilleenit va loayrit liorish y phadeyr, Reynn ad my gharmadyn nyn mast’ oc, as er my chooat ren ad lottyn y hilgey.",
36 And sitting down they watched him there;,As hoie ad sheese as watch ad Eh ayns shen.,
"37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.","As hoie ad harrish e chione oyr e vaaish scruit, SHOH YEESEY REE NY HEWNYN.",
"38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.","Eisht va daa vaarlagh er ny chrossey marish: yn derrey yeh er y laue yesh, as y jeh elley er y laue chiare.",
"39 ¶And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,"," As doltooan y vooinjer va goll shiaghey Eh, craa nyn ging,",
"40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.","As gra, Uss ta lieggal y chiamble, as dy hroggal eh reesht ayns tree laa, saue oo hene: my she Mac Yee oo, tar neose jeh’n chrosh.",
"41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,","Myr shen myrgeddin ren ny ard-saggyrtyn craidey mysh, marish ny scruderyn as y chanstyr, as dooyrt ad,",
"42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.","Haue Eh feallagh elley, Eh hene cha vod Eh hauail: my she ree Israel Eh, lig da cheet neose jeh’n chrosh, as nee mad credjal ayn.",
"43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.","Hreisht Eh ayns Jee; lig da Eh y livrey nish my sallish Eh: son dooyrt Eh, She Mac Yee mee.",
"44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.",Hilg ny maarlee myrgeddin v’er nyn grossey marish yn leid cheddin er.,
45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.,"Nish veih yn cheyoo oor, va dorraghys harrish ooilley’n cheer, gys yn nuyoo oor.",
"46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?","As mygeayrt yn nuyoo oor, deïe Yeesey lesh ard choraa, gra, Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani? ta shen dy ghra, My Yee, My Yee, cre’n fa t’ow er my hreigeil?",
"47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.","Dooyrt paart jeusyn va nyn shassoo ayns shen, tra cheayll ad shen, Ta’n dooinney shoh geamagh er Elias.",
"48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.","As chelleeragh roih fer jeu, as ghow Eh spunge, as lhieen Eh eh lesh vinegar, as hug Eh eh er cuirtliagh, as heeyn Eh eh huggey dy iu.",
"49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.","Dooyrt y vooinjer elley, Faag-jee eh, hee mad jig Elias dy hauail Eh.",
"50 ¶Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost."," Tra va Yeesey er n’eamagh reesht lesh ard choraa, phaart Eh.",
"51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;","As cur-my-ner, va’n coodaghey va eddyr y chiamble as yn ynnyd casherick rapit veih my chielley, veih’n vullagh gys y laare; as ren y thalloo craa, as ny creggyn scoltey,",
"52 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,","As va ny oaiaghyn er nyn vosley, as ren ymmodee jeh kirp ny nooghyn va nyn gadley, girree seose,",
"53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.","As cheet ass ny hoaiaghyn oc, lurg yn irree-seose-reesht echey, as goll stiagh ayns yn ard-valley casherick, as ad hene y hoilshaghey da ymmodee.",
"54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.","Nish tra honnick yn captan-keead, as adsyn va marish watchal Yeesey, yn craa-thallooin, as ny reddyn v’er jeet gy kione, ghow ad aggle mooar, gra, Dy firrinagh shoh va Mac Yee.",
"55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:","As va ymmodee mraane ayns shen (va dy akin Eh foddey vow) va er n’eiyrt er Yeesey veih Galilee, as er hirveish er.",
"56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.","Nyn mast’ oc va Moirrey Malaine, as Moirrey moir James as Joses, as moir cloan Zebedee.",
"57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:","Tra va’n fastyr er jeet, haink dooinney berchagh jeh Arimathea, va enmyssit Joseph, va myrgeddin Eh hene er chredjal ayns Yeesey.",
"58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.","Hie Eh shoh gys Pilate, as ren Eh aghin son corp Yeesey: eisht hug Pilate saarey yn corp dy ve er ny livrey.",
"59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,","As tra va Joseph er ghoaill yn corp, hoïll Eh eh ayns aanrit glen,",
"60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.","As doanluck Eh eh ayns yn oaie noa echey hene, v’eh er ny chley ayns creg: as rowll Eh clagh vooar er beeal yn oaie, as jimmee Eh roish.",
"61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.","As va Moirrey Malaine, as Moirrey elley, nyn soie jeeragh er yn oaie.",
"62 ¶Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,"," Nish yn nah laa lurg laa yn aarlaghey, haink ny ard-saggyrtyn as ny Phariseeyn cooidjagh gys Pilate,",
"63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.","Gra, Vainshtyr, ta cooinaghtyn ain dy dooyrt yn moltere shen, choud as v’eh foast bio, Lurg three laa neem’s girree reesht.",
"64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.","Cur saarey er-y-fa shen yn oaie dy ve jeant shickyr, derrey yn tress laa, er aggle dy jig yn vooinjer t’er ve sheer geiyrt er ayns yn oie, as dy geid ad Eh ersooyl, as dy jir ad rish yn pobble, T’eh er n’irree veih ny merriu: myr shen bee’n molteraght s’jerree ny smessey na’n chied volteraght.",
"65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.","Dooyrt Pilate roo, Ta watch eu, immee-jee reue, jean-jee cha shickyr jeh as oddys shiu.",
"66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.","Myr shen hie ad as ren ad yn oaie shickyr, sealal y chlagh, as soiaghey watch.",
,CAB. XXVIII.,
"In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.","Tra va’n doonaght ec kione, as y laa toshiaght soilshaghey er y chied laa jeh’n chaghtin, haink Moirrey Malaine, as Moirrey elley dy voddagh ad yn oaie y akin. ",
"2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.","As cur-my-ner, va craa-thallooin mooar ayn; son va ainle y Chiarn er jeet neose veih niau, as er jeet as er rowlal back y chlagh jeh beeal yn oaie, as er hoie er.",
"3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:","Va’n eddin echey goll-rish y tendeil, as e choamrey gial myr y sniaghtey.",
"4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.","As ayns aggle roish, ren y vooinjer va watchal craa, as haink ad dy ve myr deiney marroo.",
"5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.","As dreggyr yn ainle, as dooyrt Eh rish ny mraane; Ny gow-jee aggle: son ta fys aym dy vel shiu shirrey Yeesey, v’er ny chrossey.",
"6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.","Cha vel Eh ayns shoh, son t’eh er n’irree, myr dooyrt Eh hene: tar-jee, jeeagh-jee er yn ynnyd raad va’n Chiarn oanluckit.",
"7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.","As immee-jee dy tappee, as insh-jee dauseyn va sheer geiyrt er, dy vel Eh er n’irree veih ny merriu; as cur-my-ner, t’eh goll reue gys Galilee, ayns shen hee shiu Eh; cur-my-ner, ta mish er n’insh diu.",
8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.,"As jimmee ad dy tappee veih’n oaie lesh aggle as boggey mooar, as roih ad dy chur lhieu yn naight gys e ostyllyn.",
"9 ¶And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him."," As myr v’ad goll dy insh eh da e ostyllyn, cur-my-ner, haink Yeesey nyn guail, gra, Dy vannee diu. As haink ad, as chum ad Eh er y chassyn, as hug ad ooashley da.",
"10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.","Eisht dooyrt Yeesey roo, Ny gow-jee aggle: immee-jee as abbyr-jee rish my vraaraghyn ad dy gholl gys Galilee, as ayns shen hee ad mee.",
"11 ¶Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done."," Nish tra v’ad goll, cur-my-ner, haink paart jeh’n watch gys yn ard-valley, as hoilshee ad da ny ard-saggyrtyn ooilley ny reddyn v’er jeet gy kione:",
"12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,","As tra v’adsyn as y chanstyr er nyn jaglym cooidjagh, as er chur nyn goyrle dy-cheilley, hug ad sim mooar dy argid da ny sidooryn,",
"13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.","Gra, Abbyr-jee shiuish, Haink e ostyllyn ayns yn oie, as gheid ad Eh ersooyl choud as va shin nyn gadley.",
"14 And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.","As my chlinnys y kiannoort jeh, ver mainyn er credjal dy vel eh firrinagh, as freillee mad shiuish sauchey. ",
"15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.","Myr shen ghow ad yn argid, as ren ad myr v’er ny chur roue: as ta’n raa shoh dy cadjin er ny insh magh mastey ny Hewnyn gys y laa t’ayn jiu.",
"16 ¶Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them."," Eisht hie yn un ostyl yeig roue gys Galilee, gys slieau raad va Yeesey er n’oardaghey daue.",
"17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.","As tra honnick ad Eh, hug ad ooashley da: agh va paart imneagh ayns nyn gredjue.",
"18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.","As haink Yeesey, as loayr Eh roo, gra, Ta dy chooilley phooar er ny chur dou ayns niau as er y thalloo.",
"19 ¶Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:"," Immee-jee er-y-fa shen as ynsee-jee dy chooilley ashoon, as bashtee-jee ad ayns ennym yn Ayr, as y Vac, as y spyrryd Noo:",
"20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.","Gynsaghey daue dy reaylley dy chooilley nhee cre-erbee ta mish er chur ayns saarey diu: as cur-my-ner, Ta mish mêriu kinjagh, gys eer jerrey’n theihll.",

"6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;","As va Ean coamrit lesh clooie chamel, as lesh cryss dy chrackan mysh ny meeghyn echey: as v’eh gee locustyn as mill feïe:",
"7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.","As ren Eh preacheil, gra, Ta fer s’pooaral na mish cheet my yei, kiangley ny braagyn echey cha vel mee feeu dy chroymmey sheese as dy eaysley.",

"9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.","As haink eh gy kione ayns ny laghyn shen, dy daink Yeesey veih Nazareth dy Ghalilee, as v’eh er ny vashtey liorish Ean ayns Jordan.",
"10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:","As chelleeragh haink Eh seose ass yn ushtey, as honnick Eh ny niaughyn foshlit, as y Spyrryd goll-rish calmane cheet neose er.",
"11 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.","As haink coraa veih niau, gra, Oo my Vac graihagh, jeed ta mee dy mooar soiaghey.",
12 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.,As chelleeragh deiyr y spyrryd Eh gys yn aasagh.,

28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.,As chelleeragh hie yn goo echey magh trooid ooilley’n cheer mygeayrt Galilee.,

"35 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:","As tra va’n laa nish foddey baarit, kaink [sic: haink] y vooinjey va sheer geiyrt er huggey, as dooyrt ad, Shoh boayl faasagh, as ta’n traa nish er gholl foddey shiaghey:",

"41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all.","As tra v’eh er ghoaill ny queig bwilleenyn as y daa eeast, yeeagh Eh seose gys niau, as vannee Eh, as vrish Eh ny bwilleenyn, as hug Eh ad dauesyn va sheer geiyrt er dy hoiaghey rymboo; as y daa eeast reynn eh nyn mast’ oc ooilley.",

"48 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.","As honnick Eh ad tooileil ayns gymmyrt; (son va’n gheay nyn oi oc) as mygeayrt y chiarroo ghoostey jeh’n oie, haink Eh huc shooyl er y cheayn, as ballish v’er gholl shiaghoo.",
"49 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a spirit, and cried out:","Agh tra honnick ad Eh shooyl er y cheayn, heïll ad dy nee scaan v’ayn, as deïe ad.",
"50 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not afraid.","(Son honnick ad ooilley Eh, as v’ad seaghnit.) As chelleeragh loayr Eh roo, as dooyrt Eh roo, Bee-jee dy yien mie, She mish t’ayn, ny gow-jee aggle.",

"56 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.","As raad erbee dy row Eh goll, gys baljyn-beggey, ny ard-valjyn, ny er y cheer, v’ad cur sleih chingey nyn lhie ayns ny straadjyn, as guee er, ad ny lomarcan dy vennaylt rish oirr e gharmad: as whilleen as venn rish, v’ad er nyn lheiys.

"Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.","Eisht haink cooidjagh huggey ny Phariseeyn as shiartance jeh ny scruderyn, haink veih Jerusalem.",

"In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,","Ayns ny laghyn shen va earroo yn pobble feer vooar, as tra nagh row veg y veaghey oc, deïe Yeesey er y vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er huggey, as dooyrt Eh roo:",

"23 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.","As ghow Eh yn dooinney doal er laue, as leeid Eh Eh magh ass y valley; as tra v’eh er chur shelley er e hooyllyn, as er chur e laueyn er, dênee Eh jeh row Eh fakin red erbee.",

30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.,"As hug Eh currym daue, gyn ad dy insh da dooinney erbee quoi v’eh.",

"And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.","As chelleeragh ayns y voghrey hug ny ard-saggyrtyn as y chanstyr as ny scruderyn, as y slane choonceil, nyn goyrle dy cheilley, as chiangle ad Yeesey, as leeid ad Eh ersooyl, as livrey ad Eh gys Pilate.",

"And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,","  As haink eh gy kione ny lurg shen, dy jagh Eh trooid dy chooilley valley, mooar as beg, preacheil as soilshaghey naightyn gerjolagh reeriaght Yee: as va’n daa ostyl yeig marish;",

"4 ¶And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:"," As tra va earroo mooar dy leih er nyn jaglym cooidjagh, as er jeet huggey ass dy chooilley ard-valley; loayr Eh liorish coraa-dorraghey:",
"5 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.","Hie corryder magh dy chuirr e rass: as myr v’eh cuirr, huit paart rish oirr y raad, as ve stampit sheese, as die eeanlee yn aer eh.",

"7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.","As huit paart mastey drineyn, as daase ny drineyn seose marish, as hoght ad eh.",
"8 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.","As huit cooid elley jeh ayns thalloo mie as daase eh seose, as dymmyrk eh mess keead-filley.

"9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?","As dênee yn vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er jeh, gra, Cre oddagh y coraa-dorraghey shoh y ve?",
"10 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.","As dooyrt Eh, Diuish te er ny choyrt dy hoiggal folliaghtyn reeriaght Yee; agh da feallagh elley ayns coraaghyn-dorraghey: fakin nagh voddagh ad fakin, as clashtyn nagh voddagh ad toiggal.",

"12 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.","Shen rish oirr y raad, yn vooinjer ta clashtyn: eisht ta’n drogh-spyrryd cheet, as goaill ersooyl yn goo ass ny creeaghyn oc, er aggle dy jeanagh ad credjal, as dy beagh ad er nyn sauail.",

"25 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.","As dooyrt Eh roo, Cre vel y credjue eu?

"26 ¶And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee."," As haink ad gys cheer ny Gadarenee, ta jeeragh er Galilee.",
"27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.","As tra v’eh er gholl er thalloo, haink ny whail ass yn ard-valley, dooinney dy row va drogh-spyrrydyn er ve ayn ry foddey, as cha row Eh ceau eaddagh, ny fuirriaght ayns thie erbee, agh mastey ny hoaiaghyn.",
"28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.","Tra honnick Eh Yeesey, deïe Eh, as huit Eh sheese kiongoyrt rish, as dooyrt Eh lesh ard choraa, Cre’n eïe t’ayd orrym, Yeesey, Vac yn Jee smoo ard?

"29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)","(Sôn v’eh er haarey yn spyrryd neu-ghlen dy heet magh ass y dooinney.

32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.,"As va griagh mooar dy vuckyn fo bochillyn er y clieau: as ghuee ad er, Eh dy chur kied daue goll stiagh ayndoo. As hug Eh kied daue.",
"33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.","Eisht hie ny drogh-spyrrydyn ass y dooinney, as hie ad stiagh ayns ny muckyn: as roih yn ghriagh gouyr nyn mullee lesh yn ughtagh gys y cheayn, as v’ad plooghit.",

"35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.","Eisht hie ad magh dy yeeaghyn cre va jeant; as haink ad gys Yeesey, as hooar ad y dooinney, ass va ny drogh spyrrydyn er gholl, ny hoie ec cassyn Yeesey, as e eaddagh er, as v’eh dy mie ayns e cheeal: as ghow ad aggle.",

"37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.","Eisht ren y slane chaglym jeh cheer ny Gadarenee mygeayrt, guee er Eh dy gholl roish vow; son va aggle mooar er duittym orroo: as hie Eh seose ayns y lhong as hyndaa Eh back reesht.",
"38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,","Nish va’n dooinney ass va ny drogh-spyrrydyn er gholl geearree dy ve marish: agh hug Yeesey Eh ersooyl, gra,",
"39 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee.

"41 ¶And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:"," As cur-my-ner, haink dooinney va enmyssit Jairus, as v’eh ny er-reïl jeh’n cheeill: as huit Eh sheese ec cassyn Yeesey, as ghuee Eh er, Eh dy heet stiagh ayns e hie:",

"47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.","As tra honnick y ven dy row ee cronnit, haink ee er-creau, as huit ee sheese ec e chassyn, as hoilshee ee da kiongoyrt rish ooilley’n pobble, cre’n oyr v’eck dy vennaylt rish, as kys v’ee er ny lheihys chelleeragh.",

"26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.","Son quoi-erbee ghoys nearey roym’s, as roish my ghoan, roishyn nee yn Mac dooinney nearey y ghoaill, tra hig Eh ayns e ghloyr hene, as gloyr e Ayrey, as ny ainlyn casherick.",

"28 ¶And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray."," As haink eh gy kione mygeayrt hoght laa lurg ny raaghyn shoh, dy ghow Eh marish, Peddyr as Ean as Jamys, as dy jagh Eh seose er slieau dy ghoaill padjer.",
"29 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.","As myr v’eh guee, va cummey yn eddin echey er ny chaghlaa, as va’n coamrey echey gial as sollys.",
"30 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:","As cur-my-ner, va daa ghooinney taggloo rish, ta shen dy ghra Moses as Elias:",
"31 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.","Haink kionfenish ayns gloyr, as ren loayrt jeh e vaase, as ny v’eh dy hurranse ec Jerusalem.",
"32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.","Agh haink cadley trome er Peddyr as orroosyn va marish: as tra v’ad er ghoostey, honnick ad yn ghloyr echey, as y daa ghooinney va nyn shassoo marish.",
"33 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.","As haink eh gy kione, myr v’ad goll dy aagail Eh, dy dooyrt Peddyr rish Yeesey, Vainshtyr, te mie er ny son ainyn dy ve ayns shoh; as lig dooin three cabbaneyn y yannoo, cabbane er dty hon’s, as cabbane son Moses, as cabbane son Elias: cha row fys echey cre v’eh dy ghra.",
"34 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.","Choud as v’eh loayrt ny goan shoh, haink bodjal ren scadoo y hilgey harrystoo: as ghow ad aggle, myr va’n bodjal cheet ’moo.",
"35 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.","As haink coraa ass y vodjal, gra, Shoh my Vac graihagh; eaisht-jee rish.",
"36 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.","As lurg y choraa, va Yeesey er ny gheddyn ny lomarcan: as dreill ad shoh oc hene, as cha dinsh ad da dooinney erbee ayns ny laghyn shen, veg jeh ny reddyn v’ad er vakin.",
"37 ¶And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him."," As haink eh gy kione yn nah laa, tra v’ad er jeet neose jeh’n clieau, dy daink ymmodee ny whail.",
"38 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.","As cur-my-ner, deïe dooinney jeh’n cheshaght, gra, Vainshtyr, ta mee guee ort jeeagh er my vac, son she my ynrycan liannoo Eh.",
"39 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.","As cur-my-ner, ta spyrryd dy ghoaill Eh, as ayns y tullogh t’eh geamagh, as t’eh dy heih noon as noall Eh derrey t’eh keshal, as er egin t’eh cheet huggey hene, erreish da y vroo Eh.",
40 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.,"As ghuee mee orroosyn ta sheer geiyrt ort ad dy hilgey ass Eh, as cha row ad abyl.",
"41 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.","As dreggyr Yeesey, gra, O heeloghe vee-chredjuagh as roonagh, caid ta mish dy ve mêriu, as dy hurranse diu? Cur lhiat dty vac ayns shoh?",
"42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.","As choud as v’eh foast cheet, chew yn drogh-spyrryd sheese, as heih Eh noon as noall Eh: agh Yeesey oghsan da’n spyrryd neu-ghlen, as laanee Eh yn liannoo, as livrey Eh Eh reesht gys e ayr.",
"43 ¶And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,"," As ghow ad ooilley yindyss mooar jeh pooar niartal Yee: Agh choud as va dy chooilley annane ayns ard imnea mychione dagh nhee va Yeesey er n’yannoo, dooyrt Eh rish y vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er,",
44 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.,Lig da ny raaghyn shoh v’er nyn glashtyn dy gyere lieriu: son bee yn Mac dooinney er ny livrey gys laueyn deiney.,
"45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.","Agh cha hoig ad y raa shoh, as ve kellit vow, nagh dug ad tastey da: as va aggle orroo fênaght jeh mychione yn raa shen.",
"46 ¶Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest."," Eisht hie ad dy resooney eddyr ad hene, quoi oc syrjey veagh.",
"47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,","As hoig Yeesey smooinaghtyn y chree oc, as ghow Eh liannoo, as hoie Eh Eh liorish.",
"48 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.","As dooyrt Eh roo, Quoi-erbee nee soiaghey jeh’n liannoo shoh ayns m’ennym’s, t’eh jannoo soiagh jeem’s: as quoi-erbee nee soiaghey jeem’s, t’eh soiaghey jehsyn t’er my choyrt: son eshyn sloo ta nyn mast’ eu ooilley, bee yn fer cheddin mooar.",
"49 ¶And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us."," As dreggyr Ean as dooyrt Eh, Vainshtyr, honnick shin fer tilgey magh drogh-spyrrydyn ayns dt’ennym’s; as liett shin Eh, er-yn-oyr nagh vel Eh geiyrt orts mârinyn.",

"51 ¶And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,"," As haink eh gy kione, myr va’n traa er jeet dy row Eh dy ve goit seose, dy ghow Eh dy shickyr ayns laue, goll seose, myr va e eddin soit, gys Jerusalem.",
"52 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.","As hug Eh chaghteryn magh roish: as jimmee ad roue, as hie ad stiagh ayns balley-beg jeh ny Samaritanee dy yannoo aarloo er e hon.",
"53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.","Agh cha dug adsyn oltaghey-bea da, er-yn-oyr dy row Eh goll er e hoshiaght gys Jerusalem.",
"54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?","As tra honnick ny ostyllyn echey Jamys as Ean shoh, dooyrt ad, Hiarn, naïlt shin dy haarey aile dy heet neose veih niau, dy choyrt ad mow, myr ren Elias?",

"56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.","Son cha vel yn Mac dooinney er jeet dy stroie bioys deiney, agh dy nyn sauail. As hie ad roue gys balley-beg elley.",
"57 ¶And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest."," As haink eh gy kione, myr v’ad goll er y raad, dy dooyrt dooinney dy row rish, Hiarn, Eiyryms ort raad erbee dy jeu.",

"53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

"There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.","Va kionfenish ec y traa shen, paart dinsh da mychione ny Galileanee, yn uill oc va Pilate er gheayrtey kione ny ourallyn oc. ",

"5 ¶He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none."," Loayr Eh myrgeddin yn coraa-dorraghey shoh : va dooinney dy row va billey-figgagh echey soit ayns e gharey-feeney, as haink Eh dy yeeaghyn row mess er, as cha dooar Eh veg.",

10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.,As v’eh gynsaghey ayns annane jeh ny kialteenyn er y doonaght.,
"11 ¶And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself."," As cur-my-ner, va ben va spyrryd dy ghoghan er ve eck rish hoght bleeaney jeig, as v’ee crybbit dy cheiley, as cha dod ee er aght erbee ee hene y yeeraghey.",

"13 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.","As hug Eh e laueyn urree ; as chelleeragh v’ee er ny yannoo jeeragh, as hug ee gloyr da Jee.",
"14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.","As dreggyr fer-reïl ny killagh lesh jymmoose, er-yn-oyr dy row Yeesey er lheihys er laa yn doonaght, as dooyrt Eh rish y pobble, Ta shey laa ayn ry hoi gobbraghey : er ny laghyn shen er-y-fa shen tar-jee dy ve er nyn lheihys, as cha nee er laa’n doonaght.",

"19 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.","Te goll-rish greine dy rass mustard, ren dooinney y ghoaill, as y hilgey ayns e gharey, as daase eh, as haink eh dy ve ny villey vooar : as ren eeanlee yn aer fastee y ghoaill ayns ny banglaneyn echey.",

"22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.","As hie Eh magh trooid ny ard-valjyn as ny baljyn-beggey, gynsaghey as goll er e hoshiaght gys Jerusalem.",
"23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them,","Eisht dooyrt fer rish, Hiarn, nee beggan ta er nyn sauail? As dooyrt eh roo.",

"25 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:","Un cheayrt dy bee mainshtyr y thie er n’irree, as y dorrys er ny yeigh, as dy jean shiuish toshiaght dy hassoo er cheu-mooie, as dy chronckal ec y dorrys, gra, Hiarn, Hiarn, foshil dooin ; as freggyr-ee eshyn as jir Eh riu, Cha vel mee goaill riu, cre voish ta shiu :",

"4 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go;","As chum ad nyn jengey. As ghow Eh as laanee Eh Eh, as lig Eh yn raad da :",

"18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,","Irree-ym, as hem roym gys my ayr, as jir-ym rish, Ayr, ta mee er n’yannoo peccah noi niau, as kiongoyrt rhyts.",
19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.,As cha vel mee ny sodjey feeu dy ve enmyssit dty vac : dell rhym myr rish fer jeh dty harvaantyn failt.,
"20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.","As hrog Eh er, as haink Eh gys e ayr. Agh tra v’eh foast foddey veih, honnick e ayr Eh, as va chymmey echey er, as roih Eh, as haar Eh e roihaghyn mysh e wannal, as phaag Eh Eh.",
"21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.","As dooyrt y mac rish, Ayr, ta mee er n’yannoo peccah noi niau, as ayns dty hilley’s, as cha vel mee ny sodjey feeu dy ve enmyssit dty vac.",
"22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:","Agh dooyrt yn ayr rish e harvaantyn, Cur-jee lhieu magh yn coamrey share, as cur-jee er eh, as cur-jee faainey er e laue, as braagyn er e chassyn.",
"23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:","As cur-jee lhieu ayns shoh yn lheiy beiyht, as mar-jee eh ; as lig dooin gee as ve gennal.",
"24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.","Son va my vac shoh marroo, as t’eh bio reesht ; v’eh caillit, as t’eh er ny gheddyn. As ren ad toshiaght dy ve gennal.",
"25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.","Nish va’n mac shinney ayns y vagher : as tra haink Eh er-gerrey da’n thie, cheayll Eh Kiaull as donsin.",
"26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.","As deïe Eh er annane jeh ny guillin, as dênee Eh cre son va shoh.",
"27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.","As dooyrt Eh rish, Ta dty vraar er jeet ; as ta dt’ayr er varroo yn lheiy beiyht, er-yn-oyr dy vel Eh er jeet thie huggey sauchey.",
"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.","28. As va farg er, as cha row Eh booiagh goll stiagh : shen-y-fa haink Eh ayr magh, as chuir Eh Eh.",
"29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:","As dreggyr eshyn, as dooyrt Eh rish e ayr, Cur-my-ner, ta mish rish whilleen blein shen ayns dty hirveish, as cha ren mee rieau noi dt’aigney, as foast cha dug oo dou rieau mannan dou, dy voddin ve gennal marish my gheiney-mooinjerey : ",
"30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.","Agh cha leah as v’eh shoh dty vac er jeet, ta er vaarail dty chooid er streebaghyn, t’ow er varroo er e hon yn lheiy beiyht.",
"31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine.","As dooyrt Eh rish, Vac, t’ow er ny ve kinjagh mârym, as lhiat ooilley ny t’aym.",
"32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.","Ve cooie dooin ve gennal, as boggey y ghoaill : son v’eh shoh dty vraar marroo, as t’eh bio reesht ; v’eh caillit, as t’eh er ny gheddyn.",
,CAB. XVI.,
"And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.","As dooyrt Eh myrgeddin rish y vooinjer va sheer marish, Va dooinney berchagh dy row as stiurt echey ; as v’eh er ny phlaint huggey dy row Eh er yummal e chooid.",
"2 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.","As deïe Eh er, as dooyrt Eh rish, Kys dy vel mee clashtyn shoh jeed? cur coontey jeh dty stiurtys : son cha vod oo ve ny sodjey dty stiurt.",
"3 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.","Eisht dooyrt y stiurt rish hene, Cre nee’m? son ta my hiarn goaill y stiurtys voym : cha voddym gobbraghey lesh my chiebbey, as ta nearey orrym goll dy hooyl ny dhieyn.",
"4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.","Ta fys aym cre nee’m, tra vee-ym er my choyrt ass y stiurtys, dy vod my vea ve oltit gys ny thieyn oc. ",
"5 So he called every one of his lord’s debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?","Myr shen deïe Eh er dy chooilley annane v’ayns lhiastynys da e hiarn, as dooyrt Eh rish y chied er, Cre-woad t’ow uss dy lhiastyn dy my hiarn?",
"6 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.","As dooyrt Eh, Keead towse dy ooill. As dooyrt Eh rish, Gow dty screeuyn, soie sheese dy tappee, as scrieu jeih as da-eed.",
"7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.","As dooyrt Eh rish fer elley, As cre-woad t’ow uss dy lhiastyn? As dooyrt Eh, Keead towse dy churnaght. As dooyrt Eh rish, Gow dty screeuyn, as scrieu kiare-feed.",
"8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.","As voyll y chiarn y stiurt neu-chairagh, er-y-fa dy row Eh er n’yannoo dy creeney : son ta cloan y theihll shoh ayns nyn sheeloghe ny s’creeney na cloan y toilshey.",
"9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.","As ta mee gra riu, Jean-jee diu hene caarjyn liorish yn mammon molteragh ; tra nee shiu failleil, dy vod ad shiu y ghoaill stiagh gys ny ynnydyn-vaghee dy bragh farraghtyn.",
10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.,"Eshyn ta ynrick ayns yn red s’fardaalee, t’eh ynrick myrgeddin ayns mooarane : as eshyn ta neu-charragh ayns y red s’fardalee, t’eh neu-chairagh myrgeddin ayns mooarane.",
"11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?","Mannagh vel shiu er-y-fa shen er ve ynrick ayns y mammon molteragh, quoi livrey-ys diu yn verchys firrinagh? ",
"12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?","As mannagh vel shiu er ve firrinagh ayns ny ta lesh dooinney elley, quoi ver diu ny vees lhieu hene?",
"13 ¶No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."," Cha vod sharvaant erbee daa vainshter y hirveish : son edyr ver Eh feoh da’n derrey yeh, as graih da’n jeh elley ; er nonney cummee Eh gys y derrey yeh, as soie-ee Eh beg jeh’n jeh elley.

"14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.","As cheayll ny Phariseeyn myrgeddin va sayntoilagh, ooilley ny reddyn shoh : as ren ad gannidys er.",
"15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.","As dooyrt Eh roo, Shiuish yn vooinjer ta dy heyrey shiu hene kiongoyrt rish deiney ; agh ta fys ec Jee er ny creeaghyn eu : son ta shen ta dy mooar soit jeh mastey deiney, feohdoil ayns shilley Yee.",
"16 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.","Va’n leigh as ny phadeyryn derrey Ean: er dyn traa shen, ta reeriaght Yee er ny phreacheil, as ta dy chooilley ghooinney chionney stiagh huggey.",
"17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.","Agh t’eh ny sassey da’n aer as da’n thalloo dy hierraghtyn, na da un tittle jeh’n leigh dy ailleil.",
"18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.","Quoi-erbee scarrys rish e ven, as phoosys ben elley, t’eh brishey poosey : as quoi-erbee phoosys ish ta scarrit veih e sheshey, t’eh brishey poosey.",
"19 ¶There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"," Va dooinney berchagh dy row va coamrit ayns gorrym-jiarg, as aanrit keyll, as jeant magh lesh gien mie dy chooilley laa. ",
"20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,","As va dooinney boght dy row va enmyssit Lazarus, va ny lhie ec y yiat echey, laane dy hingyn,",
21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.,As geearree dy ve jeant magh lesh y vrooilliagh va tuittym jeh boayrd y dooinney verchagh : agh haink ny eer moddee as sliee ad ny chingyn echey.,
"22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;","As haink eh gy kione, dy dooar y dooinney boght baase, as dy dug dy ainlyn lhieu Eh gys oghrish Abraham : hooar y dooinney berchagh myrgeddin baase, as v’eh er ny oanluckey.",
"23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.","As ayns niurin, raad v’eh er ny horchaghey, hrog Eh seose Eh hooyllyn, as honnick Eh Abraham foddey veih, as Lazarus ayns e oghrish.",
"24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.","As deïe Eh, as dooyrt Eh, Ayr Abraham, jean myghin orrym, as cur Lazarus, dy vod Eh baare e vair y hummey ayns ushtey, as my hengey y eayraghey ; son ta mee er my horchaghey ayns y lossey shoh.",
"25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.","Agh dooyrt Abraham, Vac, cooinee ayns earish dty vea dy ren uss dty reddyn mie y ghoaill, as myrgeddin Lazarus reddyn sie : agh nish t’eshyn er ny gherjaghey, as t’ow uss er d[t]y horchaghey.",
"26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.","As marish shoh ooilley, ta eddyr shinyn as shiuish diunid vooar soit : myr shen adsyn ta aignagh dy gholl veih shoh hiuish, cha vel ad abyl ; chamoo oddys adsyn cheet hooinyn, ta aignagh dy heet veih shen.",
"27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:","Eisht dooyrt Eh, Ta mee guee ort er-y-fa shen, ayr, dy chur Eh gys thie my ayr :",
"28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.","Son ta queig braaraghyn aym ; dy vod Eh feanish y ymmyrkey daue, er son nagh jig adsyn myrgeddin gys y boayl shoh dy horchagh.",
"29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.","Dooyrt Abraham rish, Ta Moses as ny phadeyryn oc ; lig daue geill y chur dauesyn.",
"30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.","As dooyrt Eh, Cha nee, O ayr Abraham : agh dy ragh fer veih ny merriu huc, ghoghe ad arrys.",
"31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.","As dooyrt Eh rish, Mannagh der ad geill da Moses as ny phadeyryn, cha greidagh ad, ga dy nirragh fer veih ny merriu.",

"Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come","Eisht dooyrt Eh rish y vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er, Cha vod eh ve nagh bee oyryn peccah ayn : agh smerg dasyn liorish ta sleih er nyn dayrn gys peccah.",
"2 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.","Veagh eh ny baare da dy beagh clagh-wyllin er ve croghit mysh e wannal, as Eh dy ve tilgit ayns y cheayn, na Eh dy hayrn gys peccah annane jeh’n vooinjer veggey shoh.",

"4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.","As my nee Eh peccah dt’oi shiaght keayrtyn ’sy laa, as shiaght keayrtyn ’sy laa chyndaa reesht hood as gra, Ta mee goaill arrys ; leih-ee oo da.",
"5 ¶And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith."," As dooyrt ny ostyllyn rish y Chiarn, Bishee yn credjue ainyn.",
"6 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.","As dooyrt y Chiarn, Dy beagh credjue eu myr greine dy rass mustard, oddagh shiu gra rish y billey-sycamine shoh, Bee er dty hayrn ass ny fraueyn, as bee er d[t]y hoiaghey ayns y cheayn ; as yinnagh eh biallys diu.",
"7 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?","Agh quoi eu ta sharvaant echey traaue, ny cur bee da’n ollagh, jir rish chelleeragh, tra vees Eh er jeet veih’n vagher, Immee as soie gys y voayrd?",
"8 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?","As nagh jir hoshiaght rish, Fow aarloo dy voddyms my hibber y gheddyn, as kaingle dty gharmad mood, as shirveish orryms, derrey vee’m erreish gee as giu, as ny lurg shen nee uss gee as giu?",
9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.,"Vel booise er da’n charvaant shen, er-yn-oyr dy ren Eh ny reddyn v’er ny haarey da? Cha vel mee smooinaghtyn dy vel.",
"10 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.","Myr shen myrgeddin shiuish, tra vees shiu er n’yannoo ooilley ny t’er ny haarey diu, abbyr-jee, She sharvaantyn neu-vondeishagh shin: ta shiu [sic: shin] er n’yannoo ynrycan ny va orrin dy yannoo.",
"11 ¶And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee."," As haink eh gy kione, myr v’eh er e yurnah gys Jerusalem, dy jimmee Eh trooid main Samaria as Galilee.",
"12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:","As myr v’eh goll stiagh ayns balley-beg dy row, haink ny whail jeih deiney va nyn louraanee, as hass ad foddey veih ;",

"14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests.

"15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,","As hyndaa fer jeu back, tra honnick Eh dy row Eh er ny laanaghey, as lesh ard choraa hug Eh moylley da Jee,",
"16 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.","As huit Eh sheese er e eddin ec ny cassyn echey, cur booise da : as v’eh ny Samaritan.",

"18 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.","Cha vel er nyn gheddyn t’er jyndaa dy chur gloyr da Jee, agh my lomarcan yn joarree shoh.",
"19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.","As dooyrt Eh rish, Irree, immee royd ; ta dty chredjue er d[t]y laanaghey.",
"20 ¶And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:"," As tra v’eh fênit jeh liorish ny Phariseeyn, cre’n traa harragh reeriaght Yee ; dreggyr Eh ad, gra, Cha jig reeriaght Yee lesh stayd chronnal.",

"22 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.","As dooyrt Eh rish y vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er, Hig ny laghyn tra vees shiu aignagh dy akin annane jeh laghyn yn Mac dooinney, as cha vaik shiu eh.",
"23 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.","As jir ad riu, Jeeagh ayns shoh, ny jeeagh ayns shid : ny roih-jee geiyrt, as ny eiyr-jee orroo.",
"24 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.","Son myr ta’n tendeil ta soilshean veih yn derrey ard fo’n aer, cur soilshey da’n ard elley fo’n aer : myr shen myrgeddin vees yn Mac dooinney ayns y laa echey.",
"25 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.","Agh hoshiaght shegin da ymmodee reddyn y hurranse, as ve beg soit jeh liorish y cheeloghe shoh.",
"26 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.","As myr ve ayns laghyn Noe, myr shen vees eh myrgeddin ayns laghyn yn Mac dooinney.",
"27 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.","V’ad gee, v’ad giu, v’ad poosey, v’ad er nyn goyrt ayns poosey, derrey yn laa hie Noe stiagh ayns yn arg : as haink y thooilley, as vaiy eh ad ooilley.",
"28 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;","As er yn un aght as ve ayns laghyn Lot, v’ad gee, v’ad giu, v’ad kionnaghey, v’ad creck, v’ad soiaghey biljyn, v’ad troggal [t]hieyn :",

"36 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.","Bee daa ghooinney ayns y vagher ; bee yn derrey yeh goit, as y jeh elley faagit.",
"37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.","As dreggyr ad, as dooyrt ad rish, C’raad, Hiarn? As dooyrt eshyn roo, Raad erbee dy bee yn corp, ayns shen vees ny urlee er nyn jaglym cooidjagh. ",

"And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;","As loayr Eh coraa dorraghey roo, dy lhisagh deiney kinjagh padjer y ghoaill, as nagh lhisagh ad ve lhiastey ;",
"2 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:","Gra, Va ayns ard-valley dy row briw nagh row ayns aggle roish Jee, ny cur geill da dooinney.",
"3 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.","As va ben-treoghe ayns yn ard-valley shen, haink huggey, gra, Cur cairys dou oi my noid.",

"9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.","Eisht ren Eh toshiaght dy loayrt rish y pobble yn coraa-dorraghey shoh: Va dooinney dy row ren garey-feeney y hoiaghey, as hoie Eh eh rish fir-hie, as hie Eh gys cheer foddey son choud shen dy hraa.",
"10 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.","As ec yn imbagh, hug Eh fer-mooinjerey gys ny fir-hie, dy voddagh ad coyrt da jeh mess y gharey-feeney : agh woaill ny fir-hie Eh, as hug ad Eh ersooyl follym.",

"52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?","Eisht dooyrt Yeesey rish ny ard-saggyrtyn as captanyn y chiamble, as y chanstyr v’er jeet magh huggey, Vel shiu er jeet magh, myr noi maarlagh, lesh cliwnyn as luirg?",
"53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.","Tra va mee mêriu gagh laa ayns y chiamble, cha heeyn shiu magh nyn laueyn m’oi : agh shoh yn oor eu, as pooar y dorraghys.",
"54 ¶Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off."," Eisht ghow ad Eh, as leeid ad as hug ad lhieu Eh gys thie yn ard-saggyrt. As deiyr Peddyr er foddey ny yei.",
"55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.","As tra v’ad er voddey aile ayns main y hall, as er hoie sheese cooidjagh, hoie Peddyr sheese nyn mast’ oc.",
"56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.","Agh hug ben-aeg dy row tastey da, myr v’eh ny hoie ec yn aile, as yeeagh ee dy gyere er, as dooyrt ee, V’eh shoh myrgeddin marish.",
"57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.","As dob Eh, gra, Ven, cha vel enney aym er.",
"58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.","As tammylt ny lurg shen, honnick fer elley Eh, as dooyrt Eh, She fer jeu myrgeddin uss. As dooyrt Peddyr, Ghooinney, cha nee.",
"59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.","As mysh oor ny lurg shen, hass fer elley er dy creoi, gra, Ayns firrinys v’eh shoh myrgeddin marish ; son she Galilean eh.",
"60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.","As dooyrt Peddyr, Ghooinney, cha vel fys aym cre t’ow dy ghra. As chelleeragh, choud as v’eh foast loayrt, gherr y kellagh.",
"61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.","As hyndaa yn Chiarn, as yeeagh Eh er Peddyr; as chooinee Peddyr er y fockle va’n Chiarn er ghra rish, Roish my gerr y kellagh, nee uss mish y obbal three keayrtyn.",
"62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.","As hie Peddyr magh, as cheayn Eh dy sharroo.",
"63 ¶And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him."," As ren ny deiney va cummal Yeesey craidey mysh, [as] y woalley Eh.",
"64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?","As tra v’ad er choodaghey ny sooyllyn echey, woaill ad Eh er yn eddin, as dênee ad jeh, gra, Jean phadeyrys, quoi ta dy dty woalley?",
65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.,As ymmodee reddyn elley loayr ad dy mollaghtagh noi.,
"66 ¶And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,"," As cha leah as va’n laa ayn, haink shanstyr yn pobble, as ny ard-saggyrtyn as ny scruderyn cooidjagh, as hug ad lhieu Eh gys y choonceil oc.",
"67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:","Gra, Nee oo yn Creest? insh dooin. As dooyrt Eh roo, My inshym diu, cha jean shiu credjal.",
"68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.","As my neem’s myrgeddin shiuish y qhuestional, cha jean shiu my reggyrt, ny’n raad y lhiggey dou.",
69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.,Ny lurg shoh nee yn Mac dooinney soie er laue yesh pooar Yee.,
"70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.","Eisht dooyrt ad ooilley, Nee oo eisht Mac Yee? As dooyrt Eh roo, Ta shiuish gra dy nee.",
"71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.","As dooyrt ad, Cre’n feme sodjey t’ain er feanishyn? son ta shin hene er chlashtyn veih’n veeall echey.",
,CAB. XXIII.,
"And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.","As dirree yn slane sheshaght jeu, as leeid ad Eh gys Pilate.",
"2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.","As ren ad toshiaght dy loayrt noi, gra, Hooar shin Eh shoh cur yn ashoon ain er shaghryn, as lhiettal sleih veih keesh y choyrt da Cesar, gra, Dy nee Eh hene Creest yn ree.",
"3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.","As dênee Pilate jeh, gra, Nee ree ny Hewnyn oo? As dreggyr Eh as dooyrt Eh, T’ow uss dy ghra eh.",
"4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.","Eisht dooyrt Pilate rish ny ard-saggyrtyn as rish y pobble, Cha vel mish er gheddyn foill erbee ayns y dooinney shoh.",
"5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.","As loayr ad ny s’jymmo[o]see, gra, T’eh boirey yn pobble, gynsaghey trooid ooilley Judea, goaill toshiaght veih Galilee derrey shoh.",
"6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.","Tra cheayll Pilate jeh Galilee, dênee Eh nee Galilean va’n dooinney.",
"7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.","As cha leah as hooar Eh fys dy nee gys reill Herod v’eh bentyn, hug Eh Eh gys Herod, va myrgeddin Eh hene ec Jerusalem ec y traa shen.",
"8 ¶And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him."," As tra honnick Herod Yeesey, v’eh feer wooiagh : son v’eh aignagh ry foddey dy akin Eh, er-yn-oyr dy row Eh er chlashtyn ymmodee reddyn jeh ; as dy row Eh treishteil dy akin mirril ennagh jeant liorish.",
9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.,Eisht dênee Eh ymmodee questionyn jeh ; agh cha dug Eh ansoor erbee da.,
10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.,As hass ny ard-saggyrtyn as ny scruderyn as loayr ad dy elgyssagh noi.,
"11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.","As ren Herod as e gheiney-caggee beg y hoiaghey jeh, as chraid ad mysh, as choamree ad Eh lesh coamrey gloyroil, as hug ad Eh reesht gys Pilate.",
12 ¶And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.," As y laa cheddin va coardail er ny yannoo eddyr Pilate as Herod ; son roie v’ad ayns noidys yn derrey yeh gys y jeh elley.",
"13 ¶And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,"," As deïe Pilate er ny ard-saggyrtyn cooidjagh, as er ny fir-reil as y pobble,",
"14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:","As dooyrt Eh roo, Ta shiu er chur lhieu yn dooinney shoh hym’s, myr fer ta cur y pobble er shaghryn : as cur-my-ner, ta mish er veysht Eh kiongoyrt riu, as cha vel mee er gheddyn foill erbee ayns y dooinney shoh, mychione ny reddyn ta shiuish cur ny lieh ;",
"15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.","Cha-moo ta Herod : son hug mee shiu huggeysyn, as cur-my-ner, cha vel nhee erbee ta toilchin baase er ny yannoo liorish.",
"16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.","Smaghtee-ym er-y-fa shen Eh, as liggym y raad da.",
17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.),Son beign da fer y eaysley daue ec yn eailley.,
"18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:","As deïe ooilley’n cheshaght, gra, Ersooyl lesh y dooinney shoh, as feaysle dooin Barabbas :",
"19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)","(Va son irree-magh dy row, va jeant ayns yn ard-valley, as son dunverys tilgit ayns pryssoon.)",
"20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.","Va Pilate er-y-fa shen booiagh feaysley choyrt da Yeesey, as loayr Eh reesht roo.",
"21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.","Agh deïe adsyn, gra, Jean y chrossey Eh, Jean y chrossey Eh.",
"22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.","As dooyrt Eh roo yn tress cheayrt, Cre’n oill t’eh er ny yannoo? cha vel mish er gheddyn oyr erbee baaish ayn : Smaghtee-ym Eh er-y-fa shen, as liggym y raad da.",
"23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.","As loayr ad ny s’jeeanney lesh ard choraaghyn, geearree Eh dy ve er ny chrossey : as ren y coraa ocsyn as coraa ny ard-saggyrtyn raad y ghoaill.",
24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.,As hug Pilate briwnys cordail rish nyn yeearree.,
"25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.","As deaysle Eh daue, eshyn va son irree-magh as dunverys tilgit ayns pryssoon, Eh v’ad er n’yannoo aghin er e hon ; agh livrey Eh Yeesey gys nyn aigney.",
"26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.","As myr v’ad dy chur lhieu Eh, haare ad greme er Simon Cyrenian dy row, va cheet ass y cheer, as ersyn hug ad y chrosh, dy ymmyrkey eh geiyrt er Yeesey.",
"27 ¶And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him."," As deiyr er earroo mooar dy leïh, as dy vraane, va myrgeddin keayney as jannoo dobberan er e hon.",
"28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.","Agh hyndaa Yeesey huc, as dooyrt Eh, Inneenyn Yerusalem, ny keayn-jee er my hon’s, agh keayn-jee er nyn son hene, as son nyn gloan.",
"29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.","Son cur-my-ner, ta ny laghyn cheet, tra jir ad, Bannit ta ny mraane gennish, as ny breïnyn nagh ren gymmyrkey, as ny keeaghyn nagh dug bainney.",
"30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.","Eisht nee ad toshiaght dy ghra rish ny sleïtyn, Tuit-jee orrin ; as rish ny cruinck, Coodee-jee shin.",
"31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?","Son my t’ad jannoo ny reddyn shoh rish y billey oor, cre vees er ny yannoo rish y billey creen?",
"32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.","As va myrgeddin daa ghrogh-yantagh elley er nyn leeideil magh marish, dy ve er nyn goyrt gy baase.",
"33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.","As tra v’ad er jeet gys yn ynnyd ta enmyssit Calvary, ayns shen ren ad eshyn y chrossey, as ny drogh-yantee ; yn derrey yeh er y laue yesh, as y jeh elley er y laue chiare.",
"34 ¶Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots."," Eisht dooyrt Yeesey, Ayr, leih daue ; son cha s’oc cre t’ad dy yannoo. As reynn ad e choamrey, as hilg ad lottyn.",
"35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.","As va’n pobble nyn shassoo jeeaghyn er : as mâroo ren ny fir-reïl myrgeddin gannidys er, as gra, Haue Eh feallagh elley ; lig da Eh-hene y hauail my she Creest reiht Yee Eh.",
"36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,","As va ny sidooryn myrgeddin craidey mysh, cheet huggey, as chebbal da vinegar,",
"37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.","As gra, My she ree ny Hewnyn oo, saue oo hene.",
"38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.","As va’n screeu shoh myrgeddin soit er-skyn e chione, ayns letteryn dy Ghreek, as dy Latin, as dy Hebrew, SHOH REE NY HEWNYN.",
"39 ¶And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us."," As ren fer jeh ny drogh-yantee v’er nyn groghey loayrt dy lunagh noi, gra, My she oo yn Creest, saue oo hene as shinyn.",
"40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?","Agh dreggyr y jeh elley, cur oghsan da, as gra, Nagh vel aggle ort roish Jee, fakin dy vel uss fo’n vriwnys cheddin?",
41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.,As shinyn dy jarroo dy cairagh ; son ta shin er gheddyn toilchinys cooie yn jannoo ain : agh cha vel y dooinney shoh er n’yannoo aggair erbee.,
"42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.","As dooyrt Eh rish Yeesey, Hiarn, cooinee orryms tra hig oo gys dty reeriaght.",
"43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.","As dooyrt Yeesey rish, Dy firrinagh ta mee gra rhyt, Dy bee uss mâryms jiu ayns paradise.",
"44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.","As ve mysh y cheyoo oor, as va dorraghys harrish ooilley yn cheer gys yn nuyhoo oor.",
"45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.","As va’n ghrian dorraghey, as y coodaghey va eddyr y chiamble as yn ynnyd casherick ve rapit veih my chielley.",
"46 ¶And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."," As tra va Yeesey er n’eamagh lesh ard-choraa, dooyrt Eh, Ayr, gys dty laueyn ta mish chymney my spyrryd : as tra v’eh er ghra shoh, phaart Eh.",
"47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.","Nish tra honnick y captan-keead cre va er jeet gy kione, hug Eh moylley da Jee, gra, Ayns firrinys v’eh shoh ny ghooinney cairagh.",
"48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.","As ooilley yn pobble v’er jeet cooidjagh gys y shilley shen, hug ad my-ner ny reddyn va jeant, as woaill ad nyn gleeau, as haink ad rhymboo.",
"49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.","As ooilley’n sleih ainjyssagh echey, as ny mraane deiyr er veih Galilee, hass ad foddey veih cur ny reddyn shoh my-ner.",
"50 ¶And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:"," As cur-my-ner va dooinney va enmyssit Joseph, va ny er-coyrlee, as ny ghooinney mie as cairagh :",
"51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.","(Cha row ayrn erbee ec Eh shoh ayns y choyrle ny’n jannoo oc) v’eh veih Arimathea, ard-valley jeh ny Hewnyn, (va myrgeddin Eh hene farkiaght son reeriaght Yee.)",
"52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.","Hie Eh shoh gys Pilate, as deearree Eh corp Yeesey.",
"53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.","As ghow Eh neose eh, as hoïll Eh eh ayns aanrit, as doanluck Eh eh ayns oaie va cleyt ayns creg, ayn nagh row rieau dooinney oanluckit roie.",
"54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.","As y laa shen va laa’n aarlaghey, as va’n doonaght tayrn er-gerrey.",
"55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.","As hie ny mraane myrgeddin haink marish veih Galilee geiyrt er y corp, as honnick ad yn oaie, as kys va’n corp er ny oanluckey.",
"56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.","As haink ad rhymboo, as hooar ad aarloo spisyn as ooillyn ; as ghow ad fea er laa’n doonaght cordail rish yn anney.",
,CAB. XXIV.,
"Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.","Nish er y chied laa jeh’n chaghtin, feer voghey ayns y voghrey, haink ad gys yn oaie, cur lhieu ny spisyn v’ad er gheddyn aarloo, as va mraane elley mâroo.",
2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.,As hooar ad y chlagh rowlit ersooyl jeh’n oaie.,
"3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.","As hie ad stiagh, as cha dooar ad corp y Chiarn Yeesey.",
"4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:","As haink eh gy kione, tra v’ad ayns imnea mooar son shoh, cur-my-ner, hass daa ghooinney lioroo ayns coamraghyn sollys.",
"5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?","As myr v’ad agglagh, as croymmey sheese nyn eddinyn gys y thalloo, dooyrt ad roo, Cre’n-fa ta shiu shirrey yn vio mastey ny merriu?",
"6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,","Cha vel Eh ayns shoh, agh er n’irree : cooinee-jee cre loayr Eh riu tra v’eh ayns Galilee,",
"7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.","Gra, Shegin da’n Mac dooinney v’er ny livrey gys laueyn deiney peccoil, as ve er ny chrossey, as y tress laa girree reesht.",
"8 And they remembered his words,","As chooinee ad er e ghoan,",
"9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.","As haink ad back veih yn oaie, as dinsh ad ooilley shoh da’n un ostyl yeig, as da ooilley’n vooinjer elley.",
"10 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.","She Moirrey Malaine, as Joanna as Moirrey moir Yamys, as mraane elley va mâroo, dinsh ny reddyn shoh da ny ostyllyn.",
"11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.","As ghow ad y ghlare oc myr taggloo ommijagh, as cha dug ad geill daue.",
"12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.","Eisht dirree Peddyr as roih Eh gys yn oaie, as chroym Eh sheese, as honnick Eh ny haanrityn nyn lhie er-lheh, as jimmee Eh roish, goaill yindyss ec ny va er daghyrt.",
"13 ¶And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs."," As cur-my-ner hie jees jeu yn laa cheddin gys balley va enmyssit Emmaus, va mysh shiaght veeilley as lieh veeilley veih Jerusalem.",
14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.,As va taggloo oc eddyr ad mychione dy chooilley nhee va er daghyrt.,
"15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.","As haink eh gy kione, choud as v’ad taggloo as resooney ry cheiley, dy daink Yeesey hene er-gerrey, as dy jagh Eh mâroo.",
16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.,As va ny sooyllyn oc lhiettit nagh dug ad enney er.,
"17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?","As dooyrt Eh roo, cre ny naightyn shoh ta shiu dy insh yn derrey yeh da’n jeh elley, myr ta shiu shooyl dy trimshagh er y raad?",
"18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?","As dreggyr fer jeu, va’n ennym echey Cleopas, as dooyrt Eh rish, Vel uss d[t]y lomarcan dty yoarree ayns Jerusalem, as nagh vel fys ayd er ny reddyn t’ayns shen er jeet gy kione er ny laghyn shoh?",
"19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:","As dooyrt Eh, Cre ny reddyn? As dooyrt adsyn rish, Mychione Yeesey dy Nazareth, va ny adeyr, as pooaral ayns jannoo as goo, kiongoyrt rish Jee, as ooilley’n pobble :",
"20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.","As kys ren ny ard-saggyrtyn as ny fir-reïl ain y livrey Eh dy ve er ny gheyrey gys baase, as t’ad er ny chrossey Eh.",
"21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.","Agh va shinyn treishteil dy nee eshyn veagh er chur livrey da Israel : as marish shoh ooilley, jiu yn tress laa neayr as hie ny reddyn shoh er jannoo.",
"22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;","Myrgeddin va shiartance dy vraane jeh’n cheshaght ain, hug orrin lane yindyss y ghoaill, liorish dy row ad dy moghey ec yn oaie :",
"23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.","As tra nagh dooar ad yn corp echey, haink ad as dooyrt ad, dy row ad er vakin ashlish dy ainlyn, dinsh daue dy row Eh bio.",
"24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.","As hie shiartance jeusyn va mârinyn gys yn oaie, as hooar ad eh er yn eer aght myr va ny mraane er ghra ; agh eshyn cha vaik ad.",
"25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:","Eisht dooyrt Eh roo, O gheiney mee-hushtagh, as moall ayns cree dy chredjal ooilley ny ta ny phadeyryn er loayrt!",
"26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?",Nagh beign da Creest ny reddyn shoh y hurranse as goll stiagh ayns e ghloyr?,
"27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.","As goaill toshiaght ec Moses, as ooilley ny phadeyryn, hug Eh tushtey daue ayns ooilley ny scriptyryn jeh ny reddyn va bentyn rish hene.",
"28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.","As haink ad er-gerrey da’n balley, raad v’ad goll : as lig Eh er dy ragh Eh ny-sodjey. ",
"29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.","Agh lhie ad er, gra, Fuirree mârin, son ta’n fastyr faggys ayn, as ayrn vie jeh’n laa ceaut. As hie Eh stiagh dy uirriaght mâroo.",
"30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.","As haink eh gy kione, myr v’eh ny hoie ec bee mâroo, dy ghow Eh arran, as vannee Eh, as vrish Eh, as heeyn Eh huc eh.",
"31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.","As va ny sooyllyn oc er nyn vosley, as hug ad enney er ; as hie Eh ersooyl ass nyn shilley.",
"32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?","As dooyrt y derrey yeh jeu rish y jeh elley, Nagh row ny creeaghyn ain lossey cheu-sthie jin, choud as v’eh taggloo rooin er y raad, as choud as v’eh fosley dooin ny scriptyryn?",
"33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,","As dirree ad seose yn oor cheddin, as haink ad back gys Jerusalem, as hooar ad yn un ostyl yeig er nyn jaglym cooidjagh, as adsyn va mâroo,",

He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.","Eisht dênee ny Phariseeyn jeh reesht, kys v’eh er gheddyn e hoilshey.

"16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.","Shen-y-fa dooyrt paart jeh ny Phariseeyn, Cha vel y dooinney shoh veih Jee, er-yn-oyr nagh vel Eh freaylley yn doonaght.

"18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.","Agh cha ren ny Hewnyn credjal mychione echey, dy row Eh er ve doal, as dy dooar Eh e hoilshey reesht, derrey deïe ad er yn ayr as y voir echyssyn v’er gheddyn e hoilshey.",
"19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?","As dênee ad jeu gra, Nee shoh yn mac eu, ta shiu gra va er ny ruggey doal? kys eisht t’eh nish fakin?",
"20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind :","Dreggyr e ayr as e voir ad, gra, Ta fys ain dy nee shoh yn mac ain, as dy row Eh er ny ruggey doal :",
"21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself.","Agh kys t’eh nish fakin, cha s’ain ; ny quoi t’er vosley ny sooyllyn echey, cha vel fys ain : t’eh ec eash, fênee-jee jeh, nee Eh loayrt er e hon hene.",
"22 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.","Ny goan shoh loayr e ayr as e voir, er-y-fa dy row ad ayns aggle roish ny Hewnyn : son va ny Hewnyn er chordail hannah, my ghoghe dooinney erbee rish dy nee Eh va’n Creest, dy beagh Eh er ny chur magh ass y cheeill.",
"23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age ; ask him.","Shen-y-fa dooyrt yn ayr as y voir echey, T’eh ec eash, fênee-jee jeh.",
"24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise : we know that this man is a sinner.","Eisht deïe ad reesht er y dooinney v’er ny ve doal, as dooyrt ad rish, Cur y moylley da Jee : ta fys ain dy nee drogh-yantagh Eh shoh.",
"25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not : one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.","Dreggyr eshyn, as dooyrt Eh, Cha s’aym’s nee drogh-yantagh Eh : un red ta fys aym er, dy row mee doal, as nish dy vel my hoilshey aym.",

"27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?","Dreggyr eshyn ad, Ta mee er n’insh diu hannah, as cha dug shiu geill : cre’n-fa bailliu y chlashtyn reesht eh? bailliu-ish myrgeddin ve jeusyn ta gynsaghey veih?

"28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple ; but we are Moses’ disciples.","Eisht doltooan ad Eh, as dooyrt ad, Tow uss gynsaghey veih ; agh ta shinyn gynsaghey veih Moses.",
"29 We know that God spake unto Moses : as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.","Ta fys ain dy loayr Jee rish Moses : agh Eh shoh, cha s’ain cre-woish t’eh.",

"33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.","Erbey dy vel y dooinney shoh veih Jee, cha voddagh Eh nhee erbee y yannoo.",
"34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.","Dreggyr ad as dooyrt ad rish, Haink uss er y theihll ooilley cooidjagh ayns peccaghyn, as vel oo gynsaghey shinyn? As hilg ad Eh magh.",

"38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.","As dooyrt Eh, Hiarn, ta mee credjal. As hug Eh ooashley da.",

"42 And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.","As va fys aym dy row kinjagh dy my chlashtyn : agh kyndagh rish y pobble va mygeayrt y moo’m, loayr mee, dy vod ad credjal dy vel oo er my choyrt.",
"43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.","As tra v’eh er ghra shoh, deïe Eh lesh ard choraa, Lazarus, tarr magh.",
"44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.","As haink eshyn va marroo magh, kainlt cass as laue lesh aanrityn baaish : as va’n eddin echey foïlt lesh naptin. Dooyrt Yeesey roo, Feayshyl-jee Eh, as lig-jee yn raad da.",
"45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.","Eisht ren ymmodee jeh ny Hewnyn v’er jeet magh gys Moirrey, as v’er vakin ny reddyn ren Yeesey, credjal ayn.",
"But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.","46. Agh hie paart jeu rhymboo gys ny Phariseeyn, as dinsh ad daue cre ny reddyn va Yeesey er n’yannoo.",
"47 ¶Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles."," Eisht deïe ny ard-saggyrtyn as ny Phariseeyn er y choonceïl cooidjagh, as dooyrt ad, Cre ta shinyn dy yannoo? son ta’n dooinney shoh jannoo ymmodee mirrillyn.",
"48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him : and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.","My liggys mad da, nee dy chooilley ghooinney credjal ayn ; as hig ny Romanee as ver ad mow chammah yn ynnyd casherick as yn ashoon ain.",
"49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,","As va fer jeu va enmyssit Caiaphas, ny ard-saggyrt yn vlein shen, as dooyrt Eh roo, Cha vel toiggal eu jeh nhee erbee,",
"50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.","Cha-moo ta shiu goaill eu hene kys te ymmyrchagh er ny son ain, un dooinney dy gheddyn baase son y pobble, as gyn y slane ashoon dy hierraghtyn.",
"51 And this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ;","As shoh loayr Eh, cha nee jeh hene : agh v’eh ny ard-saggyrt yn vlein shen, as ren Eh phadeyrys dy voghe Yeesey baase son yn ashoon shen :",
"52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.","As cha nee ynrycan son yn ashoon shen, agh myrgeddin dy jinnagh Eh cloan Yee va skeaylt dy liane, y hayrn gys annanys ry cheïley.",
53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.,Eisht veih’n laa shen magh v’ad cur nyn goyrle dy cheïley dy choyrt Eh gy baase.,
"54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.","Cha jimmee Yeesey er-y-fa shen ny smoo dy foshlit mastey ny Hewnyn ; agh hie Eh veih shen gys cheer v’er er-gerrey da’n aasagh, gys ard-valley enmyssit Ephraim, as duirree Eh ayns shen marish y vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er.",
"55 And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.","As va Caisht ny Hewnyn tayrn er-gerrey : as va ymmodee ass y cheer goll seose gys Jerusalem roish y Chaisht, dy ghlenney ad hene.",
"56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?","As v’ad briaght son Yeesey, as loayrt nyn mast’ oc hene, myr v’ad nyn shassoo ayns y chiamble, Cre ta shiu dy smooinaghtyn, nagh jig Eh seose gys yn eailley?",
"57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.","Nish va chammah ny ard-saggyrtyn as ny Phariseeyn er chur saarey, my va fys ec dooinney erbee c’raad v’eh, dy row Eh dy hoilshaghey eh, dy voddagh ad Eh y ghoaill.",
,CAB. XII.,
"Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.","Eisht shey laa roish y Chaisht, haink Yeesey gys Bethany, raad va Lazarus v’er ny ve marroo, Eh v’eshyn er hroggal veih ny merriu.",
2 There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.,"Ayns shen ren ad shibber er e hon, as va Martha shirveish orroo : agh va Lazarus fer jeusyn va nyn soie ec y voayrd mârish.",
"3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.","Eisht ghow Moirrey punt dy ooill dy spikenard feer deyr, as ren ee cassyn Yeesey y ooillaghey, as rub ee e chassyn lesh e folt : as va’n thie er ny lhieeney lesh soar yn ooill.",
"4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray him,","Eisht dooyrt fer jeh ny ostyllyn echey, Yuaase Iscariot mac Simon, va kiarrail Eh y vrah,",
"5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?","Cre’n-fa nagh row yn ooill shoh creckit son three cheead ping, as er ny choyrt da ny boghtyn?",
"6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.","Shoh dooyrt Eh, cha nee son dy row kiarrail erbee er jeh ny boghtyn ; agh er-yn-oyr dy nee maarlagh v’eh, as dy nee echey va’n sporran, as ny v’ad dy choyrt ayn eshyn va dy chur lesh eh.",
"7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this.","Eisht dooyrt Yeesey, Faag-jee ee : noi laa my oanluckey t’ee er hashtey shoh.",
8 For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always.,Son ny boghtyn t’ad eu kinjagh mêriu ; agh mish cha vel eu kinjagh.,
"9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.","Va fys er-y-fa shen ec ymmodee jeh pobble ny Hewnyn dy row Eh ayns shen : as haink ad, cha nee er coontey Yeesey ny lomarcan, agh dy voddagh ad Lazarus y akin myrgeddin, Eh v’eshyn er hroggal veih ny merriu.",
10 ¶But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;," Agh hug ny ard-saggyrtyn nyn goyrle dy cheïley, mychione Lazarus myrgeddin y choyrt gy-baase ;",
"11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.","Er-y-fa er y choontey echyssyn dy row ymmodee jeh ny Hewnyn er gholl roue, as er chredjal ayns Yeesey.",
"12 ¶On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,"," Er yn nah laa ren ymmodee jeh’n pobble v’er jeet gys yn eailley, tra cheayll ad dy row Yeesey cheet gys Jerusalem, ",
"13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.","Banglaneyn dy viljyn-palm y ghoaill, as hie ad magh ny whaill, as deïe ad, Hosanna ; bannit ta ree Israel ta cheet ayns ennym y Chiarn.",
"14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon ; as it is written,","As tra va Yeesey er gheddyn assyl aeg, varkee Eh urree : myr te scruit,",
"15 Fear not, daughter of Sion : behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.","Ny gow aggle, inneen Sion : cur-my-ner, ta dty Ree cheet, markiagh er lhie assyl.",
"16 These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.","Ny reddyn shoh cha hoig y vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er ec y toshiaght : agh tra va Yeesey er ny ghloyraghey, eisht chooinee ad dy row ny reddyn shoh scruit jeh, as dy row ad er n’yannoo ny reddyn shoh rish.",
"17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.","Ren y pobble er-y-fa shen va marish, tra deïe Eh er Lazarus ass yn oaie, as tra hrog Eh Eh veih ny merriu feanish y ymmyrkey.",
"18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.","Er-yn-oyr shoh va’n pobble myrgeddin er gholl magh ny whaill, son dy geayll ad dy row Eh er n’yannoo yn mirril shoh.",
"19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.","Dooyrt ny Phariseeyn er-y-fa shen nyn mast’ oc hene, Nagh vaik shiu nagh vel shiu jannoo veg y vie? cur-my-ner, ta’n seihll er gholl geiyrt er.",
20 ¶And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :," As va shiartance dy Ghreekyn nyn mast’ oc, v’er jeet seose dy chur ooashley ec yn eailley :",
"21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.","Haink ad shoh er-y-fa shen gys Philip, va veih Bethsaida ayns Galilee, as ren ad aghin huggey, gra, Vainshtyr, baillin Yeesey y akin.",
22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.,"Haink Philip as dinsh Eh da Andreays, as reesht dinsh Andreays as Philip shoh da Yeesey.",
"23 ¶And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified."," As dreggyr Yeesey ad, gra, Ta’n oor er jeet, dy vel yn Mac dooinney dy ve er ny ghloyraghey. ",
"24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone : but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.","Dy firrinagh firrinagh ta mee gra riu, Mannagh vel y greine curnaght tuittym ayns y thalloo, as goll eag, te cummal ny un ghreine kinjagh : agh my te goll eag : te gymmyrkey magh lane mess.",
25 He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.,"Eshyn ta graihagh er e vioys, caillee Eh eh : agh eshyn ta feoh echey er e vioys ’sy theihll shoh, freillee Eh eh gys y vea veayn.",
"26 If any man serve me, let him follow me ; and where I am, there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.","My nee dooinney erbee mish y hirveish, lig da geiyrt orrym ; as y raad ta mish, ayns shen myrgeddin vees my harvaant : my nee dooinney erbee mish y hirveish, dasyn ver my Ayr onnor.",
"27 Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour.","Nish ta m’annym seaghnit ; as cre jirrym? Ayr, saue mee veih’n oor shoh : agh er-yn-oyr shoh haink mee gys yn oor shoh.",
"28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.","Ayr, cur gloyr da dt’ennym hene. Eisht haink coraa veih niau, gra, Ta mee chammah er ghloyraghey eh, as nee’m eh y ghloyraghey reesht.",
"29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered : others said, An angel spake to him.","Dooyrt y pobble er-y-fa shen va nyn shassoo ayns shen, as cheayll eh, dy row taarnagh ayn : dooyrt feallagh elley, Dy nee ainle ren loayrt rish.",
"30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.","Dreggyr Yeesey ad as dooyrt Eh, Cha daink y coraa shoh er y choontey aym’s, agh er y nyn son eauish.",
31 Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out.,Nish ta briwnys y theihll shoh ayn : nish vees prince y theihll shoh er ny hilgey magh.,
"32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.","As my veem’s er my hroggal seose jeh’n thalloo, tayrnym dy chooilley ghooinney hym.",
"33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.","(Shoh loayr Eh, dy hoilshaghey cre’n baase v’eh dy hurranse.)",
"34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?","Dreggyr y pobble Eh, Ta shin er chlashtyn ass y leigh, dy vel Creest tannaghtyn son dy bragh : as kys tow uss gra, Dy vel y Mac dooinney dy ve troggit seose? quoi yn Mac dooinney shoh?",
"35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.","Eisht dooyrt Yeesey roo, Foast tammylt beg ta’n soilshey mêriu : immee-jee choud as ta’n soilshey eu, er aggle dy jig y dorraghys erriu : son cha vel fys echyssyn ta shooyll ayns y dorraghys c’raad t’eh goll.",
"36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.","Choud as ta soilshey eu, cred-jee ayns y toilshey, dy vod shiu ve nyn gloan jeh’n toilshey. Ny reddyn shoh loayr Yeesey, as jimmee Eh roish, as dollee Eh Eh hene voue.",
"37 ¶But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him :"," Agh ga dy ren Eh whilleen mirril kiongoyrt roo, foast cha chred ad ayn :",
"38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?","Dy voddagh y raa loayr Esaias y phadeyr ve cooilleenit, Hiarn, quoi ta er chredjal yn goo ain? as quoi gys ta roih yn Chiarn er ve soilshit?",
"39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,","Shen-y-fa cha voddagh ad credjal, er-y-fa dy row Esaias er ghra reesht,",
"40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.","T’eh er gholley ny sooyllyn oc, as er chreoghey nyn gree ; son nagh vaikagh ad lesh nyn sooyllyn, as nagh doiggagh ad lesh nyn gree, as nagh beagh ad er nyn jyndaa, as dy jinnin ad y lheihys.",
"41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.","Ny reddyn shoh loayr Esaias, tra honnick Eh yn ghloyr echey, as tra loayr Eh jeh.",
"42 ¶Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue :"," Ny-yeih mastey ny ard fir-reïl myrgeddin ren ymmodee credjal ayn ; agh kyndagh rish ny Phariseeyn cha ghow ad rish, er aggle dy beagh ad er nyn goyrt magh ass y cheeill.",
43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.,"Son v’ad ny sondee er moylley gheiney, ny moylley Yee.",
"44 ¶Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me."," Deïe Yeesey as dooyrt Eh, Eshyn ta credjal aynyms, cha nee aynyms t’eh credjal, agh aynsyn t’er my choyrt.",

"46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.","Ta mish er jeet my hoilshey gys y theihll, son nagh jean quoi-erbee nee credjal aynym tannaghtyn ayns y dorraghys.",
"47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.","As my ta dooinney erbee ta clashtyn, as nagh vel credjal my ghoan, cha vel mish dy vriwnys Eh : son cha daink mee dy vriwnys y seihll, agh dy hauail y seihll.",
"48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.","Eshyn ta soiaghey beg jeem’s, as nagh vel goaill huggey my ghoan, ta shen echey ta dy vriwnys Eh : yn goo ta mifh er loayrt, nee shen y vriwnys Eh ec y laa er-jerrey.",
"49 For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.","Son cha vel mish er loayrt jee’m pene ; agh yn Ayr t’er my choyrt, eshyn hug saarey dou, cre yiarrin, as cre loayrin.",
"50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.","As ta fys aym, yn saarey echyssyn dy nee yn vea veayn eh : cre-erbee er-y-fa shen ta mee dy loayrt, she myr ta’n Ayr er ghra rhym, myr shen ta mee loayrt.",
,CAB. XIII.,
"Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.","Nish va fys ec Yeesey, roish feailley ny Caisht, dy darragh yn oor v’eh dy gholl ass y theihll shoh gys yn Ayr, myr v’eh graihagh er e vooinjer hene, va ayns y theihll, hug Eh graih daue gys y jerrey.",
"2 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him ;","As myr v’ad gee nyn shibber, (va’n drogh-spyrryd nish er choyrt eh ayns cree Yuaase Iscariot mac Simon, dy vrah Eh.)",
"3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God ;","Va fys ec Yeesey dy row yn Ayr er chur dy chooilley nhee ayns ny laueyn echey, as dy nee veih Jee haink Eh, as dy nee gys Jee v’eh goll,",
"4 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel, and girded himself.","Dirree Eh veih shibber, as hug Eh jeh e gharmadyn, as ghow Eh aanrit, as chiangle Eh eh eh mysh.",
"5 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.","As ny lurg shen, hug Eh ushtey ayns baishin, as ren Eh toshiaght dy niee cassyn e ostyllyn, as dy rubbey ad lesh yn aanrit va echey mysh.",
"6 Then cometh he to Simon Peter : and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?","Eisht haink Eh gys Simon Peddyr : as dooyrt Peddyr rish, Hiarn, vel uss niee my chassyn’s?",
"7 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter.","Dreggyr Yeesey as dooyrt Eh rish, Cha vel fys ayd nish cre ta mee dy yannoo ; agh bee fys ayd er ny yei shoh.",

"9 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.","Dooyrt Simon Peddyr rish, Hiarn, cha nee ny lomarcan my chassyn, agh myrgeddin my laueyn, as my chione.",
"10 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit : and ye are clean, but not all.","Dooyrt Yeesey rish, Eshyn ta nieet, cha vel feme echey agh dy niee e chassyn, agh t’eh glen ooilley harrish : as ta shiuish glen, agh cha vel shiu ooilley myr shen.",
"11 For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean.","Son va fys echey quoi va ry hoi y vrah Eh ; shen-y-fa dooyrt Eh, Cha vel shiu ooilley glen.",
"12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?","Myr shen erreish da v’er niee ny cassyn oc, as tra v’eh er ghoaill e gharmadyn, as er hoie sheese reesht, dooyrt Eh roo, Vel fys eu cre ta mee er n’yannoo riu?",

"17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.","My ta fys eu er ny reddyn shoh, bannit vees shiu ad y yannoo.",
"18 ¶I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me."," Cha vel mee loayrt jiu ooilley ; ta fys aym quoi ta mee er reih : agh dy vod y scriptyr ve cooilleenit, T’eshyn ta gee arran mârym, er hroggal e voyn m’oi.",

"21 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.","Tra va Yeesey er ghra shoh, v’eh seaghnit ayns e spyrryd, as dymmyrk Eh feanish, as dooyrt Eh, Dy firrinagh firrinagh ta mee gra riu, dy jean annane eauish mish y vrah.",

"23 Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.","Nish va ny lhie er oghrish Yeesey, fer jeh ny ostyllyn echey v’eh graihagh er.",
"24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake.","Chrie Simon Peddyr er-y-fa shen er, Eh dy ênaght quoi jeh v’eh loayrt.",
"25 He then lying on Jesus’ breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it?","Myr v’eh eisht ny lhie gys oghrish Yeesey, dooyrt eh rish, Hiarn, quoi Eh?",
"26 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.","Dreggyr Yeesey, She eshyn Eh da verrym greym dy arran, tra vee’m er hummey eh.

"29 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or, that he should give something to the poor.","Son heill paart, er-yn-oyr dy nee ec Yuaase va’n sporran, dy row Yeesey er ghra rish, Kionnee ny vees mad ny eme couyr yn eailley : ny Eh dy chur red ennagh da ny boghtyn.",
30 He then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night.,"Erreish da eisht v’er ghoaill yn greym dy arran, hie Eh chelleeragh magh : as va’n oie ayn.",

"12 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,","Eisht ghow yn cheshaght, as y captan, as fir-oik ny Hewnyn Yeesey, as chiangle ad Eh,",
"13 And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.","As leeid ad Eh ersooyl gys Annas hoshiaght (son v’eh shen ny ayr ’sy leigh da Caiaphas, va ny ard-saggyrt yn vlein shen.)",

"15 ¶And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest."," As deiyr Simon Peddyr as ostyl elley er Yeesey.

"16 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.","Agh hass Peddyr ec y dorrys er cheu-mooie.

"18 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.","As va ny sharvaantyn as ny fir-oik nyn shassoo ayns shen, ec aile geayill v’ad er n’yannoo (son ve feayr) as v’ad dyn jiow ad-hene : as hass Peddyr mâroo, as hiow Eh Eh hene.",
"19 ¶The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine."," Dênee yn ard-saggyrt eisht jeh Yeesey mychione yn vooinjer va sheer geiyrt er, as mychione yn ynsagh echey.",
"20 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing.","Dreggyr Yeesey Eh, Loayr mee dy foshlit rish y theihll : Dynsee mee kinjagh ayns y cheeill, as ayns y chiamble, raad ta ny Hewnyn kinjagh thaaghey, as dy follit cha vel mee er ghra nhee erbee.",
"Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them : behold, they know what I said.","21. Cre’n-fa t’ow fênaght jee’ms? fênee jeusyn t’er my chlashtyn, cre ta mee er ghra roo : cur-my-ner, ta fys oc cre ta mee er ghra.",
"22 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?","As tra v’eh erreish ny goan shoh y loayrt, woaill fer jeh ny fir-oik va ny hassoo ayns shen Yeesey lesh bass e laue, gra, Nee shen myr t’ow freggyrt yn ard-saggyrt?",

24 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.,(Nish va Annas er choyrt Eh kainlt gys Caiaphas yn ard-saggyrt.),
"25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.","As va Simon Peddyr ny hassoo as dy hiow Eh hene : Dooyrt ad er-y-fa shen rish, Nagh nee fer jeh’n vooinjer va sheer geaiyrt er uss neesht?

"26 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?",Dooyrt fer jeh sharvaantyn yn ard-saggyrt (va moonjerys dasyn va Peddyr er yiarey yn chleash jeh) Nagh vaik mish oo marish ayns y gharey?,
27 Peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew.,"Eisht dob Peddyr reesht, as chelleeragh gherr y kellagh.",
"28 ¶Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover."," Eisht leeid ad Yeesey veih Caiaphas gys hall y vriwnys : as ve moghey, as cha jagh ad hene stiagh ayns hall ny briwnys, er aggle dy beagh ad neu-ghlen ; as nagh voddagh ad yn Eayn-caisht y ee.",
"29 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?","Hie Pilate eisht magh huc, as dooyrt Eh, Cre ta shiu dy chur gys lieh yn dooinney shoh?",
"30 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.","Dreggyr adsyn as dooyrt ad, Erbey dy nee drogh-yantagh Eh, cha beagh shin er livrey Eh hoods.",
"31 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :","Eisht dooyrt Pilate roo, Gow-jee shiuish Eh, as briwnys-jee Eh cordail rish y leigh eu.

"32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.","Dy voddagh y raa loayr Yeesey ve cooilleenit, soilshaghey cre’n baase v’eh dy hurranse.",
"33 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?","Eisht hie Pilate stiagh reesht ayns hall ny briwnys, as deïe Eh er Yeesey, as dooyrt Eh rish, Nee ree ny Hewnyn oo?",

"36 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence.","Dreggyr Yeesey, Cha vel my reeriaght’s jeh’n theihll shoh : dy beagh my reeriaght jeh’n theihll shoh, eisht veagh my harvaantyn er chaggey, nagh b’eïn er my livrey gys ny Hewnyn, agh nish cha nee veih shoh ta my reeriaght.",
"37 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king.

Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.","Dooyrt Pilate er-y-fa shen rish, Vel oo dty ree eisht? Dreggyr Yeesey, Tow uss dy ghra dy vel mee my ree.

"Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.","Eisht ghow Pilate er-y-fa shen Yeesey, as chust Eh Eh. ",
"2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,","As fee ny sidooryn attey dy ghrineyn, as hug ad eh er y chione echey, as hug ad er coamrey gorrym-jiarg.",

"13 ¶When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha."," Tra cheayll Pilate er-y-fa shen yn raa shoh, hug Eh lesh Yeesey magh, as hoie Eh sheese er stoyl y vriwnys, ayns ynnyd ta enmyssit yn Pavement, agh ayns Hebrew, Gabbatha.",

"20 This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.","Yn screeu shoh eisht ren ymmodee jeh ny Hewnyn y lhaih, son va[’]n boayl raad v’eh er ny chrossey er-gerrey da’n ard-valley : as ve scruit ayns Hebrew, as Greek, as Latin.",

"23 ¶Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout."," Eisht ghow ny sidooryn, tra v’ad er chrossey Yeesey, e gharmadyn (as ren ad kiare ayrnyn jeu, ayrn da dy chooilley hidoor) as myrgeddin e chooat : nish va’n cooat ooilley feeit, veih heose dy heese, fegooish seam.",
"24 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.","Dooyrt ad er-y-fa shen nyn mast’ oc hene, Ny lig dooin y rapey eh, agh lottyn y hilgey er, quoi echey vees eh : dy voddagh y scriptyr ve cooilleenit, ta gra, Reynn ad my gharmad nyn mast’ oc, as er my chooat ren ad lottyn y hilgey.

"28 ¶After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst."," Ny lurg shoh, son dy row fys ec Yeesey dy row dy chooilley nhee nish cooilleenit, dy voddagh y scriptyr ve jeant mie, dooyrt Eh, Ta mee paagh.",
"29 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.","Nish va saagh er ny hoiaghey laane vinegar : as lhieen ad spunge lesh vinegar, as hug ad eh er hyssop, as heeyn ad eh seose gys y veeal echey.",
"30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished : and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.","Tra va Yeesey er-y-fa shen er ghoaill y vinegar, dooyrt Eh, Te cooilleenit : as chroym Eh e chione, as phaart Eh.",
"31 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.","Shen-y-fa ren ny Hewnyn, er-yn-oyr dy nee laa’n aarlaghey ve, son nagh beagh ny kirp er y chrosh er laa’n doonaght (son va’n doonaght shen ny ard laa) guee er Pilate, ny lurgaghyn oc dy ve brisht, as ad dy ve goit ersooyl.",

"33 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs :","Agh tra haink ad gys Yeesey, as dy vaik ad dy row Eh hannah marroo, cha vrish ad ny lurgaghyn echey.",

"37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.","As reesht ta scriptyr elley gra, Jeeaghee ad ersyn t’ad er hoylley.",
"38 ¶And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus."," As ny lurg shoh ren Joseph dy Arimathea (va ny schoyllar dy Yeesey, agh dy follit ayns aggle roish ny Hewnyn) guee er Pilate, Eh dy lhiggey da corp Yeesey y ghoaill ersooyl ; as hug Pilate kied da : Haink Eh er-y-fa shen, as hug Eh lesh corp Yeesey.",
"39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.",As haink myrgeddin Nicodemus (va roie er jeet gys Yeesey ayns yn oie) as hug Eh lesh mysh keead punt dy myrrh as dy aloes kione y chielley.,

"19 ¶Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you."," Eisht er y laa cheddin, yn chied laa jeh’n chiaghtin, ayns yn astyr, tra va ny dorryssyn jeight, raad va ny ostyllyn er nyn jaglym cooidjagh ayns aggle roish ny Hewnyn, haink Yeesey as hass Eh kiongoyrt roo, as dooyrt Eh roo, Shee dy row hiu.",

"22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost :","As tra v’eh er ghra shoh, heid Eh orroo, as dooyrt Eh roo, Gow-jee yn Spyrryd Noo.",
"23 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.","Da quoi-erbee ta shiuish leih peccaghyn, t’ad er nyn leih daue ; as da quoi-erbee nagh vel shiu cur feaysley, cha vel ad feayslit.",
"24 ¶But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came."," Agh cha row Thomase, fer jeh’n daa ostyl yeig va enmyssit Didymus, mâroo tra haink Yeesey.",
"25 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.","Dooyrt ny ostyllyn elley er-y-fa shen rish, Ta shin er vakin y Chiarn.

"26 ¶And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them : then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you."," As lurg hoght laa reesht va ny ostyllyn echey sthie, as Thomase mâroo : as haink Yeesey, choud as va ny dorryssyn jeight, as hass Eh kiongoyrt roo, as dooyrt Eh, Shee dy row hiu.",

After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias ; and on this wise shewed he himself.,"Ny yei shoh hoilshee Yeesey Eh hene reesht da ny ostyllyn, ec faarkey Tiberias ; as er yn aght shoh hoilshee Eh Eh hene.",

"7 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.","Shen-y-fa dooyrt yn ostyl shen bynney lesh Yeesey rish Peddyr, She yn Chiarn t’ayn.

"8 And the other disciples came in a little ship ; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.","As haink ny ostyllyn elley ayns lhong veg (son cha row ad foddey veih’n thalloo, agh mysh daa cheead chraue-roih) sleydey lhieu yn lieen as yn eeast ayn.",

"10 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.","Dooyrt Yeesey roo, Cur-jee lhieu jeh’n eeast ta shiu nish er ghoaill.",
"11 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.","Hie Simon Peddyr seose, as hayrn Eh yn lieen gys thalloo laane dy eeastyn mooarey, keead as three jeig as da-eed : as son ooilley dy row whilleen, ny-yeih cha vrish y lieen.",

"17 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me?

"20 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following ; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?","Eisht hyndaa Peddyr mygeayrt, as honnick Eh cheet geiyrt orroo yn ostyl bynney lesh Yeesey ; eshyn lhie gys e oghrish ec shibber, as dooyrt, Hiarn, Quoi Eh ta dy dty vrah?",

"23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die : yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die ; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?","Eisht hie yn raa shen magh mastey ny braaraghyn, nagh voghe yn ostyl shen baase : agh cha dooyrt Yeesey rish, Cha vow Eh baase : agh, My saïllyms Eh dy uirriaght derrey’n cheet aym, cre ta shen dhyts?",

"21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught.

"34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ;","Eisht hass seose ayns y choonceïl Pharisee dy row, va enmyssit Gamaliel, fer-ynsee jeh’n leigh, jeh va ooilley’n pobble jannoo soiagh mooar, as doardee Eh ny ostyllyn y chur magh tammylt beg, ",

"38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought :","As nish ta mish gra riuish, Lig-jee fea da ny deiney shoh, as cur-jee eïe orroo : son my ta’n choyrle shoh, ny’n obbyr shoh jeh deiney, hed eh naardey :",

"And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.","As ayns ny laghyn shen tra va’n earroo ocsyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue er nyn mishaghey, daase ny Grecianee neu-wooiagh jeh ny Hebrewyn, son nagh row ayrn er ny chur da ny mraane-treoghe oc jeh ny va shirveishit gagh laa.

"And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.","As va aigney Saul lhieu ayns y choyrt Eh gy baase.

"14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John :","Nish tra va ny ostyllyn va ec Jerusalem er chlashtyn dy row Samaria er ghoaill goo Yee, hug ad huc Peddyr as Ean.",

14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.,"As ayns shoh ta pooar echey veih ny ard-saggyrtyn, dy chiangley ooilley ny ta geamagh er dt’ennym’s.",
"15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel :","Agh dooyrt y Chiarn rish, Immee royd : son t’eh ny haagh reiht dooys, dy ymmyrkey my ennym kiongoyrt rish ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, as reeaghyn, as cloan Israel.",
16 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.,"Son soilshee-yms da, cre ny reddyn mooarey shegin da y hurranse son m’ennym’s.",
"17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.","As jimmee Ananias roish, as hie Eh stiagh ayns y thie ; as hug Eh e laueyn er, as dooyrt Eh, Vraar Saul, ta’n Chiarn (ta shen dy ghra, Yeesey honnick oo er y raad myr haink oo) er my choyrt’s, dy voddagh oo dty hoilshey y gheddyn, as ve lhieent lesh y Spyrryd Noo.",
"18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.","As chelleeragh huit veih ny sooyllyn echey myr dy beagh eh scaailey ; as hooar Eh ec y traa cheddin e hoilshey, as dirree Eh, as v’eh er ny vashtey.",
"19 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.","As tra v’eh er ghoaill beaghey, v’eh er [n]y niartaghey. Eisht duirree Saul shiartance dy laghyn maroosyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue ec Damascus.",
"20 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.","As chelleeragh ren Eh Creest y phreacheil ayns ny kialteenyn, dy nee Mac Yee Eh.",
"21 But all that heard him were amazed, and said ; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?","Agh ghow ooilley ny va dy chlashtyn Eh yindyss mooar, as dooyrt ad, Nagh nee shoh Eh va dyn eiyrt gys baase adsyn va geamagh er yn ennym shoh ayns Jerusalem, as nagh daink Eh er y chee shen, dy voddagh Eh nyn goyrt lesh ad kainlt gys ny ard-saggyrtyn?",
"22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.","Agh daase Saul ny s’dunnallee dy chooilley laa, as cha row ny Hewnyn va vaghey ec Damascus abyl loayrt n’oi, tra v’eh jannoo mie jeh dy nee shoh yn Creest firrinagh.",
"23 ¶And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him :"," As tra va ymmodee dy laghyn ec kione, hug ny Hewnyn nyn goyrle dy cheïley dy varroo Eh :",
24 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.,"Agh hooar Saul fys er y drogh aigney v’ad ayn da : as v’ad watchal ec ny giattyn laa as oie dy varroo Eh. ",
"25 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.","Eisht ghow adsyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue Eh ayns yn oie, as lig ad Eh sheese rish y voall ayns basket. ",
"26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.","As tra va Saul er jeet gys Jerusalem v’eh booiagh lhiantyn hucsyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue, agh v’ad ooilley ayns aggle roïsh, as cha row ad credjal dy row Eh jeh’n chredjue oc. ",
"27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.","Agh ghow Barnabas Eh, as hug Eh lesh Eh gys ny ostyllyn, as hoilshee Eh daue, kys v’eh er vakin yn Chiarn er y raad, as dy row Eh er loayrt rish, as kys v’eh er preacheil dy dunnal as dy foshlit ec Damascus ayns ennym Yeesey.",
28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.,As v’eh mâroo ayns y cheet stiagh as y goll magh oc ec Jerusalem.,
"29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him.","As loayr Eh dy foshlit as lesh dunnalys ayns ennym y Chiarn Yeesey, as ren Eh hene as ny Grecianee resooney noi ry hoi : agh ghow adsyn ayns laue dy marragh ad Eh.",
"30 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.","Agh tra hoig ny braaraghyn shoh, hug ad lhieu Eh sheese gys Cesarea, as hug ad Eh magh gys Tarsus.",
"31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.","Eisht hooar yn agglish fea trooid ooilley Judea, as Galilee, as Samaria, as haink ee dy mie er e toshiaght, as liorish dy huïll ee ayns gerjagh yn Spyrryd Noo, v’ee er ny bishaghey.",
"32 ¶And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda."," As haink eh gy kione tra va Peddyr er gholl harrish ooilley ny ardjyn, dy daink Eh neose myrgeddin gys ny nooghyn va vaghey ec Lydda.",
"33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.","As ayns shen hooar Eh dooinney dy row va enmyssit Eneas, v’er chummal e lhiabbee rish hoght bleeaney, as va’n chingys-craa er. ",
"34 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.","As dooyrt Peddyr rish, Eneas, ta Yeesey Creest dy dty laanaghey : irree, as jean dty lhiabbee. As dirree Eh chelleeragh.",
"35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.","As honnick ooilley fir-vaghee Lydda as Saron Eh, as hyndaa ad gys y Chiarn.",
"36 ¶Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did."," Nish va ec Joppa ben dy row jeh’n chredjue yiarragh ad Tabitha ree, va ayns glare elley enmyssit Dorcas : va’n ven shoh er n’yannoo ymmodee obbraghyn mie, as er chur lane da ny boghtyn. ",
"37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died : whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.","As haink eh gy kione ayns ny laghyn shen, dy row ee ching, as dy dooar ee baase : as tra v’ad er y niee ee, hug ad ee ny lhie er lout. ",
"28 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.","As son wheesh as dy row Lydda er-gerrey da Joppa, as dy row adsyn jeh’n chredjue er chlashtyn dy row Peddyr ayns shen, hug ad huggey daa ghooinney, dy ghuee er Eh dy ghoaill y trubble dy heet huc. ",
"39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.","Eisht dirree Peddyr, as hie Eh mâroo. Tra v’eh er jeet, hug ad lhieu Eh seose er y lout : as hass ooilley ny mraane-treoghe liorish keaney, as jeeaghyn da ny cooatyn as ny garmadyn va Dorcas er n’yannoo, choud as v’ee er-mayrn.",
"40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed ; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter, she sat up.","Ag[h] hug Peddyr ad ooilley magh, as ghlioon Eh sheese, as ghow Eh padjer, as hyndaa Eh gys y corp, as dooyrt Eh, Tabitha, irree seose. As doshil ee e sooyllyn : as tra honnick ee Peddyr, hoie ee seose.",
"41 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.","As ghow Eh ee er y laue, as hrog Eh ee seose : as tra v’eh er n’eamagh er ny nooghyn as ny mraane-treoghe, hoie Eh ee kiongoyrt roo bio.",
42 And it was known throughout all Joppa ; and many believed in the Lord.,As va shoh er ny hoilshaghey magh trooid ooilley Joppa ; as ren ymmodee credjal ayns y Chiarn.,
"43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.","As haink eh gy kione, dy duirree Eh ymmodee dy laghyn ayns Joppa marish tanner dy row va enmyssit Simon.",
,CAB. X.,
"There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian band,","Va dooinney dy row ayns Cesarea, enmyssit Cornelius, va ny chaptan-keead er y cheshaght va enmyssit yn cheshaght Italian ;",
"2 A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.","Dooinney crauee, va beaghey ayns aggle Yee, Eh hene as ooilley e hie, as v’eh cur ymmodee jeirkyn da’n pobble, as guee gys Jee kinjagh.",
"3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.","Honnick Eh shoh ayns ashlish dy plain, mysh yn nuyoo oor jeh’n laa, ainle dy Yee cheet stiagh huggey, as gra rish, Cornelius.",
"4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God.","As tra yeeagh Eh seose er, v’eh agglagh, as dooyrt Eh, Cre shoh Hiarn? As dooyrt Eh rish, Ta ny padjeryn as ny jeirkyn ayd er jeet seose son cooinaghtyn kiongoyrt rish Jee. ",
"And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter :","5. As nish cur deiney gys Joppa, dy eamagh er Simon ta slennooit Peddyr :",
"6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.","T’eh goaill aaght marish Simon yn tanner, ta’n thie echey rish oirr ny marrey : inshee eshyn dhyt cre lhisagh oo y yannoo.",
"7 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;","As tra va’n ainle loayr rish Cornelius er gholl roish, deïe Eh er jees jeh ny fir-vooinjerey echey, as er sidoor crauee jeusyn va tendeil er kinjagh :",
"8 And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.","As tra v’eh er hoilshaghey dy chooilley nhee jeu shoh daue, hug Eh ad gys Joppa.",
"19 ¶On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :"," Laa ny vairagh myr v’ad goll er nyn yurnah, as tayrn er-gerrey da’n ard-valley, hie Peddyr seose er mullagh y thie gys padjer, mysh y cheyoo oor.",
"10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten : but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,","As daase Eh feer accryssagh, as v’eh booiagh v’er n’ee : agh choud as v’ad jannoo aarloo er e hon, huit Eh my-nealloo,",
"11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth :","As honnick Eh niau er ny osley, as saagh dy row cheet neose huggey, myr dy beagh eh brelleein vooar, kainlt ec ny kiare binn, as lhiggit sheese er y thalloo :",
"12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.","Ayn va dy chooilley vonney dy veiyn kiare-cassagh y thallooin, dy veiyn feïe, as reddyn ta snauee er y thalloo, as eeanlee yn aer.",
"13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter ; kill, and eat.","As haink coraa huggey, Irree, Pheddyr ; marr, as ee,",
"14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord ; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.","Agh dooyrt Peddyr, Foddey dy row shen voym, Hiarn ; son cha vel mish rieau er n’ee nhee erbee dy vel cadjin ny neu-ghlen.",
"15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.","As loayr y coraa rish reesht yn nah cheayrt, Shen ta Jee er ny ghlenney, ny enmyss uss cadjin.",
16 This was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven.,Va shoh jeant three keayrtyn : as va’n saagh goit seose reesht gys niau.,
"17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,","Nish choud as va Peddyr ayns imnea ayn hene, cre va meanal yn ashlish v’eh er vakin ; cur-my-ner, va ny chaghteryn haink veih Cornelius er gheddyn magh thie Simon liorish briaght, as v’ad nyn shassoo ec y dorrys,",
"18 And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.","As deïe ad, as dênee ad row Simon va slennooit Peddyr goaill aaght ayns shen.",
"19 ¶While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee."," Choud as va Peddyr smooinaghtyn er yn ashlish, dooyrt y Spyrryd rish, Cur-my-ner, ta three deiney fênaght er dty hon.",
"20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing : for I have sent them.","Irree er-y-fa shen, as gow sheese, as gow mâroo, as ny bee faittagh : son ta mish er nyn goyrt ad.",
"21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come?","Eisht hie Peddyr sheese gys ny chaghteryn haink huggey veih Cornelius ; as dooyrt Eh, Cur-my-ner, Mish Eh ta shiu dy hirrey : cre’n-oyr v’eu er-y-fa shen dy heet??",
"22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.","As dooyrt adsyn, Cornelius yn captan-keead, dooinney cairagh, as ta beaghey ayns aggle Yee, as echey ta goo mie mastey ooilley ashoon ny Hewnyn, er gheddyn raaue veih Jee liorish ainle casherick, dy chur fys orts gys e hie, dy eaishtagh rish dty ghoan.",
"23 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.","Eisht deïe Eh orroo stiagh, as hooar Eh aaght daue. As laa ny vairagh hie Peddyr mâroo, as hie myrgeddin shiartance jeh ny braaraghyn mârish veih Joppa.",
"24 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.","As yn laa er-giyn haink ad gys Cesarea : as va Cornelius feeau er y cheet oc, as v’eh er n’eamagh er e gheiney-mooinjerey cooidjagh, as e reih caarjyn.",
"25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.","As tra va Peddyr cheet stiagh, hie Cornelius ny whail, as huit Eh sheese ec e chassyn, as hug Eh ooashley da.",
"26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up ; I myself also am a man.","Agh hrog Peddyr seose Eh, gra, Shass seose ; ta mish mee hene myrgeddin my ghooinney.",
"27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.","As myr v’eh loayrt rish, hie Eh stiagh, as hooar Eh ymmodee er nyn jaglym cooidjagh.",
"28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation ; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.","As dooyrt Eh roo, Ta fys eu dy nee red neu-lowal eh da dooinney ta ny Hew, dy reaylley sheshaght rish, ny dy heet gys annane erbee jeh ashoon elley : agh ta Jee er hoilshaghey dooys, nagh lhisin jeeaghyn er dooinney erbee dy ve cadjin ny neu-ghlen.",
"29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?","As she shoh va’n oyr haink mee hiu dy arryltagh, cha leah as hug shiu fys orrym : baïllym er-y-fa shen shiu dy insh dou cre son hug oyr shiu fys orrym.",
"30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,","As dooyrt Cornelius, Kiare laa er dy henney va mish my hrostey gys yn oor shoh, ac [sic: as] ec yn nuyoo oor ghow mee padjer ayns my hie, as cur-my-ner, hass dooinney kiongoyrt rhym ayns coamrey sollys,",
"31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.","As dooyrt Eh, Cornelius, ta dty phadjer er ny chlashtyn, as dty yeirkyn freilt ayns cooinaghtyn ayns shilley Yee.",
"32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side : who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.","Cur fys er-y-fa shen gys Joppa, dy eamagh er Simon ta slennooit Peddyr ; t’eh goaill aaght ayns thie Simon yn tanner, rish oirr ny marrey : as tra hig Eh, loayree Eh rhyt.",
"33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.","Chelleeragh er-y-fa shen hug mee fys ort ; as t’ow er n’yannoo dy mie dy vel oo er jeet.

"34 ¶Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons :"," Eisht doshil Peddyr e veeal, as dooyrt Eh, Ayns firrinys ta mee cur tastey nagh vel Jee soiaghey jeh persoonyn :",
"35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.","Agh ayns dy chooilley ashoon, eshyn ta goaill aggle roïsh, as gobbraghey cairys, t’eh goit gys foayr liorish.",
"36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ : (he is Lord of all :)","Yn goo hug Jee gys cloan Israel, preacheil shee liorish Yeesey Creest (eshyn y Chiarn ain ooilley)",
"37 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached ;","Yn goo shen (ta mee gra) ta fys eauish dy row eh er ny hoilshaghey magh trooid ooilley Judea, as dy ghow eh toshiaght veih Galilee, lurg y bashtey ren Ean y phreacheil ;",
"38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for God was with him.","Kys dy ren Jee Yeesey dy Nazareth y ooillaghey lesh y Spyrryd Noo, as lesh pooar ; hie Eh mygeayrt jannoo mie ; as slaanaghey ooilley ny va’n drogh spyrryd er heaghnaghey : son va Jee mârish.",
"39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :","As ta shinyn nyn veanishyn jeh dy chooilley nhee ren Eh chammah ayns cheer ny Hewnyn, as ayns Jerusalem ; as dy ren ad Eh y varroo as y croghey er billey :",
"40 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly ;","Eshyn ta Jee er hroggal seose yn tress laa, as er hoilshaghey Eh dy foshlit,",
"42 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.","[sic: 41] Cha nee da ooilley yn pobble, agh da feanishyn va reiht ro-laue liorish Jee, dy jarroo dooinyn ren gee as giu marish, erreish da v’er n’irree veih ny merriu.",
"42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.","As hug Eh saarey dooin dy phreacheil gys y pobble, as dy ymmyrkey feanish dy nee eshyn, liorish oardagh Yee, ta dy ve briw ny bio as ny merriu.",
"43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.","Leshyn ta ooilley ny phadeyryn gymmyrkey feanish, trooid yn ennym echey, quoi-erbee chreddys ayn, dy vow Eh feaysley peccaghyn.",
"44 ¶While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word."," Choud as va Peddyr loayrt ny goan shoh, huit y Spyrryd Noo orroosyn ooilley va clashtyn y goo.",
"45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.","As ghow adsyn jeh’n yiarey-chymmylt va er chredjal, yindyss mooar, whilleen as haink marish Peddyr, er-y-fa orroosyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh myrgeddin dy row gioot y Spyrryd Noo er ny gheayrtey magh.",
"46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,","Son cheayll ad ad loayrt lesh chengaghyn, as cur ard-voylley da Jee. Eisht dreggyr Peddyr,",
"47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?","Vod dooinney erbee ushtey y lhiettal, nagh bee ad shoh er nyn mashtey, ta er gheddyn y Spyrryd Noo, chammah as shinyn?",
48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.,As hug Eh saarey ad dy ve er nyn mashtey ayns ennym y Chiarn. Eisht ghuee ad er dy uirriaght shiartance dy laghyn.,
,CAB. XI.,
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.,"As cheayll ny ostyllyn as ny braaraghyn va ayns Judea, dy row adsyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh er ghoaill orroo goo Yee.",
"2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,","As tra va Peddyr er jeet seose gys Jerusalem, hooar braaraghyn y yiarey-chymmylt foill da,",
"3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.","Gra, Hie oo stiagh gys deiney nagh row er nyn yiarey chymmylt, as ren oo gee mâroo. ",
"4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them, saying,","Agh hoilshee Peddyr kys ve veih yn toshiaght, as hoie Eh eh ayns order rhymboo, gra,",
"5 I was in the city of Joppa praying : and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners ; and it came even to me :","Va mish ec padjer ayns ard-valley Joppa ; as huit mee my-nealloo, as honnick mee ayns ashlish, saagh dy row cheet neose, myr dy beagh eh brelleein vooar, lhiggit neose veih niau er ny kiare binn ; as haink eh hym’s.",
"6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.","As tra va mee er yeeaghyn dy gyere er, as er ghoaill tastey, honnick mee beiyn kiare-chassagh y thallooin, as beiyn feïe, as reddyn ta snaaue er y thalloo, as eeanlee yn aer.",
"7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter ; slay and eat.","As cheayll mee coraa gra rhym, Irree, Pheddyr ; marr as ee.",
"8 But I said, Not so, Lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.","Agh dooyrt mish, Foddey dy row shen voym, Hiarn : son cha vel nhee erbee dy vel cadjin ny neu-ghlen ec traa erbee er gholl stiagh ayns my veeal.",
"9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.","Agh dreggyr y coraa mee reesht veih niau, Shen ta Jee er ny ghlenney, ny enmyss uss cadjin.",
10 And this was done three times : and all were drawn up again into heaven.,As va shoh jeant three keayrtyn : as va ooilley tayrnit seose reesht gys niau.,
"11 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.","As cur-my-ner, ayns y traa, va three deiney hannah er jeet gys y thie raad va mee, v’er nyn goyrt hym veih Cesarea.",
"12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house :","As doardee yn Spyrryd dou goll mâroo, as nagh by lhias dou aggle y ghoaill. As hie ny shey braaraghyn shoh ry heshaght mârym, as hie shin stiagh ayns thie yn dooinney :",
"13 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter ;","As hoilshee Eh dooin, kys v’eh er vakin ainle ayns e hie, hass as dooyrt rish, Cur deiney gys Joppa dy eamagh er Simon ta slennooit Peddyr :",
"14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved.","Eh nee goan y livrey dhyt, lioroo oddys oo hene as ooilley dty hie ve er nyn sauail.",
"15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.","As tra ren mee toshiaght dy loayrt, huit y Spyrryd Noo orroo, myr huit Eh orrinyn ec y toshiaght.",
"16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.","Eisht chooinee mee er goo yn Chiarn, kys dooyrt Eh, Ren Ean dy jarroo bashtey lesh ushtey ; agh bee shiuish er nyn mashtey lesh y Spyrryd Noo.",
"17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ ; what was I, that I could withstand God?","My hug Jee eisht dauesyn yn un yioot hug Eh dooinyn v’er chredjal ayns y Chiarn Yeesey Creest, cre’n phooar v’aym’s dy hassoo noi Jee? ",
"18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.","Tra cheayll ad shoh, chum ad nyn jengey, as hug ad gloyr da Jee, gra, Eisht ta Jee er yialdyn da ny eer Ashoonyn-quaagh arrys gys bea.",
"19 ¶Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only."," Nish va’n vooinjer v’er nyn skeayley magh, kyndagh rish y tranlaase va jeant er coontey Steaon, er droailt choud as Phenice, as Cyprus, as Antioch, as cha ren ad yn goo y phreacheil da annane erbee agh ynrycan da ny Hewnyn.",
"20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.","As va paart jeu deiney veih Cyprus as Cyrene, as tra v’ad er jeet gys Antioch loayr ad roosyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, preacheil yn Chiarn Yeesey.",
"21 And the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.","As va laue yn Chiarn lhieu : as ren earroo mooar dy leih credjal, as chyndaa gys y Chiarn.",
"22 ¶Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch."," Eisht haink naightyn jeh ny reddyn shoh gys clashtyn yn agglish va ec Jerusalem : as hug ad magh Barnabas derrey Antioch.",
"23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.","As tra v’eh er jeet as er vakin grayse Yee, ghow Eh boggey, as choyrlee Eh ad ooilley, lesh shickyrys cree ad dy lhiantyn gys y Chiarn.",
"24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the Lord.","Son v’eh ny ghooinney mie, as laane jeh’n Spyrryd Noo, as jeh credjue ; as ren ymmodee dy leih chyndaa gys y Chiarn.",
"25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul :","Eisht jimmee Barnabas gys Tarsus dy hirrey Saul. As tra v’eh er gheddyn Eh, hug Eh lesh Eh gys Antioch.",
"26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.","As haink eh gy kione, dy duirree ad choud as bleïn ayns shen ayns sheshaght ny hagglish, as dy dynsee ad ymmodee dy leih ; as v’adsyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue enmyssit Creesteenyn hoshiaght ayns Antioch.",
27 ¶And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.," As ayns ny laghyn shen haink phadeyryn veih Jerusalem gys Antioch.",
"28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.","As hass seose fer jeu enmyssit Agabus, as hoilshee Eh liorish y Spyrryd, dy beagh genney vooar trooid ooilley yn theihll ; red haink gy kione ayns laghyn Claudius Cesar. ",
"29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea :","Eisht ghow adsyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue ayns laue, dy chooilley ghooinney lurg e phooar, dy chur cooney gys ny braaraghyn va vaghey ayns Judea.",
"30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.","As ren ad shen neesht, as hug ad eh gys y chanstyr liorish laueyn Barnabas as Saul.",

Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.,Nish mysh y traa shen heeyn Herod yn ree magh e laueyn dy yannoo tranlaase er shiartance jeh’n agglish.,
2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.,As varr Eh Jamys braar Ean lesh y chliwe.,
"3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)","As er-y-fa dy dug Eh tastey dy row shoh booiys ny Hewnyn, hie Eh ny sodjey er e hoshiaght dy ghoaill Peddyr neesht. (Shen y traa va laghyn yn arran millish ayn.)",
"4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.","As tra v’eh er ghoaill Eh, hug Eh Eh ayns pryssoon, as livrey Eh Eh gys shey sidooryn jeig dy reaylley Eh, kiarrail lurg y Chaisht dy chur lesh Eh magh gys y pobble.",
5 Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.,Va Peddyr er-y-fa shen freilt ayns pryssoon ; agh va padjer er ny yannoo kinjagh gys Jee er e hon.,
"6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison.","As tra baillish Herod v’er choyrt lesh magh Eh, yn oie cheddin va Peddyr ny chadley eddyr daa hidoor kianlt lesh daa yeuley ; as va feallagh soit ec y dorrys dy watchal y phryssoon.",
"7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison : and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.","As cur-my-ner, haink ainle y Chiarn huggey, as ren soilshey soilshean ayns y phryssoon : as woaill Eh Peddyr er y lhiattee, as ghooisht Eh Eh, gra, Irree seose dy tappee.

"8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.","As dooyrt yn ainle rish, Cur dty chryss ort as kiangle ort dty vraagyn : As ren Eh shen. As dooyrt Eh rish, Cur dty gharmad mood, as eiyr orryms.",
"9 And he went out, and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision.","As hie Eh magh as deiyr Eh er, as cha row fys echey dy row ny va’n ainle er n’yannoo firrinagh ; agh heill Eh dy nee ashlish v’eh dy akin. ",
"10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city ; which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out, and passed on through one street ; and forthwith the angel departed from him.","Tra v’ad er gholl shiaghey yn chied as yn nah ghard, haink ad gys y giat yiarn ta leeideil gys yn ard-valley, as doshil eh daue jeh hene : as hie ad magh as jimmee ad trooid un straaid, as chelleeragh daag yn ainle Eh.",
"11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.","As tra va Peddyr er jeet huggey hene, dooyrt Eh, Nish ta fys aym ayns shickyrys dy vel y Chiarn er choyrt e ainle dy my livrey veih laue Herod, as veih ooilley ny va kiarit my chouyr liorish pobble ny Hewnyn.",
"12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark ; where many were gathered together praying.","As tra v’eh er smooinaghtyn er hene, haink Eh gys thie Moirrey moir Ean, va slennooit Mark, raad va ymmodee er nyn jaglym cooidjagh, ec padjer.",
"13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.","As tra va Peddyr er chronckal ec dorryss y yiat, haink ben-aeg va enmyssit Rhoda dy ênaght quoi v’ayn.",
"14 And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.","As tra hug ee enney er coraa Pheddyr, cha doshil ee yn giat son boggey, agh roih ee stiagh as dinsh ee daue dy row Peddyr ny hassoo ec y yiat.",
"15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.","Dooyrt adsyn ree, T’ow ass dty cheeal. Agh hass ish er kinjagh dy nee Eh v’ayn. Eisht dooyrt ad, She yn ainle echey t’ayn.",
"16 But Peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.","Agh chum Peddyr cronckal ec y dorrys : as tra v’ad er vosley da, as er vakin dy nee Eh v’ayn, ghow ad lane yindyss.",
"17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.","Agh chrie eshyn e laue orroo ad dy chummal nyn jengey, as hoilshee Eh daue kys va’n Chiarn er chur lesh Eh ass y phryssoon.

"18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.","Nish cha leah as va’n laa ayn, va streeu mooar mastey ny sidooryn cre’n erree v’er jeet er Peddyr.",
"19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.","As tra va Herod dy hirrey magh Eh, as nagh row Eh ry gheddyn, deaysht Eh yn vooinjer va currym y phryssoon orroo, as doardee Eh ad dy ve er nyn goyrt gy baase.

"20 ¶And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon : but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace ; because their country was nourished by the king’s country."," As va Herod treeal goll dy ghaggey rish ny Tyrianee as ny Sidonianee : agh haink ad lesh un aigney huggey, as hooar ad stiagh rish Blastus, er va currym y chamyr va’n Ree lhie ayn, as hir ad shee ; er coontey dy row yn cheer oc cummit seose liorish cheer y Ree.",
"21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.","As laa dy row, hug Herod er e choamrey reeoil, as hoie Eh er e stoyl-reeoil, as loayr Eh myr dy beagh Eh jannoo sharmane daue. ",
"22 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.","As dyllee yn pobble, She coraa Yee t’ayn, as cha nee coraa dooinney.",
"23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.","As chelleeragh woaill ainle y Chiarn Eh, er-y-fa nagh dug Eh yn gloyr da Jee : as diee beishteigyn Eh, as hooar Eh baase.",
24 ¶But the word of God grew and multiplied.," Agh ren goo Yee bishaghey as mooadaghey.",
"25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.","As haink Barnabas as Saul back veih Jerusalem, tra v’ad er chooilleeney yn chirveish oc, as hug ad lhieu mâroo Ean va slennooit Mark.",
,CAB. XIII.,
"Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.","Nish va ayns yn agglish va ec Antioch, shiartance dy adeyryn as dy ir-ynsee ; myr Barnabas as Simeon, va enmyssit Niger, as Lucius yn Cyrenean, as Manaen va troggit marish Herod yn tetrarch, as Saul.",
"2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.","Roo shoh va tendeil er shirveish y Chiarn as trostey, dooyrt y Spyrryd Noo, Soie-jee dooys er-lheh Barnabas as Saul, son yn obbyr huggey ta mee er n’eamagh ad.",
"3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.","As tra v’ad er hrostey as er ghoaill padjer, as er chur nyn laueyn orroo, hug ad ad ersooyl.",
"4 ¶So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus."," Myr shen jimmee adsyn v’er nyn goyrt magh liorish y Spyrryd Noo, gys Seleucia ; as veih shen hiauill ad gys Cyprus.",
"5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister.","As tra haink ad gys Salamis, ren ad goo Yee y phreacheil ayns kialteenyn ny Hewnyn : as va Ean oc foue son shirveishagh.",
"6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus :","As tra v’ad er gholl trooid yn Ellan gys Paphos, hooar ad ayns shen fer-obbee dy row, phadeyr-foalsey, Hew va enmyssit Barjesus :",
"7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.","Va marish kiannoort ny cheerey, Sergius Paulus, dooinney dy hushtey mie : hug Eh shoh fys er Barnabas as Saul, geearree goo Yee y chlashtyn.",
"8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.","Agh hass Elymas yn fer-obbee (son shen meanal yn ennym echey) nyn oi oc, shirrey yn kiannoort y reaylley veih chyndaa gys y chredjue.",
"9 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him.","Agh yeeagh Saul (ta myrgeddin enmyssit Paul) myr v’eh lhieent lesh y Spyrryd Noo, dy feer yhere [sic] er, ",
"10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?","As dooyrt Eh, O uss ta laane jeh dy chooilley volterys as dy olkys, vac y Jouyl, noid dy chooilley chairys, nagh scuir uss veih shaghrynys y chur er sleih huïllagh ayns raadjyn cairagh y Chiarn? ",
"11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.","As nish cur-my-ner, ta laue yn Chiarn ort, as bee oo doal, cha vaik oo yn ghrian son earish. As chelleeragh huit kay as dorraghys er ; as hie Eh mygeayrt shirrey feallagh huïllagh ny chione.",
"12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.","Tra honnick yn kiannoort eisht cre va er daghyrt, ren Eh credjal, as ghow Eh yindyss mooar jeh goo yn Chiarn.",
"13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.","Nish tra va Paul as e heshaght er hiaulley veih Paphos, haink ad gys Perga ayns Pamphylia : as daag Ean ad, as hie Eh back gys Jerusalem.",
"14 ¶But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down."," Agh tra v’ad er gholl veih Perga, haink ad gys Antioch ayns Pisidia, as hie ad stiagh ayns y cheeill er laa yn doonaght, as hoie ad sheese.",
"15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.","As lurg lhaih yn leigh as ny phadeyryn, hug fir-reïl ny killagh fys huc, gra, Gheiney as vraaraghyn, my ta fockle erbee dy choyrle eu dy chur da’n pobble, loayr-jee.",
"16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.","Eisht hass Paul seose, as chrie Eh e laue orroo, as dooyrt Eh, Gheiney Israel, as shiuish ta goaill aggle roish Jee, eaisht-jee.",
"17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.","Ren Jee yn pobble shoh Israel ny ayraghyn ain y reih, as yn pobble y hoiaghey seose tra v’ad er nyn yoarreeaght ayns cheer Egypt, as lesh laue niartal hug Eh lesh ad magh ass Egypt.",
18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness.,"As mysh da-eed blein dy hraa hrog Eh ad ayns yn aasagh, myr ta bondyr troggal liannoo.",
"19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot.","As tra v’eh er stroie shiaght ashoonyn ayns cheer Chanaan, reynn Eh yn thalloo oc orroo liorish lottyn.",
"20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.","As ny lurg shen hug Eh daue briwnyn, mysh kiare cheead as jeih bleeaney as daeed, derrey Samuel yn phadeyr.",
"21 And afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.","As ny lurg shen deearree ad Ree : as hug Jee daue Saul mac Cis, dooinney jeh sheeloghe Benjamin, son da-eed blein.",
"22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king ; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.","As tra v’eh er scughey eshyn, hoie eh David seose dy ve ny Ree daue ; gymmyrkey feanish lesh myrgeddin as gra, Ta mee er gheddyn magh David mac Jesse, dooinney lurg my chree hene, nee cooilleeney ooilley my aigney.",
"23 Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus :","Jeh sluight y dooinney shoh ta Jee, cordail rish e yialdyn, er hroggal seose da Israel Saualtagh Yeesey :",
24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.,"Erreish da Ean v’er phreacheil, tra v’eshyn aarloo dy heet, bashtey arrys da ooilley pobble Israel.",
"25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.","As myr va Ean cooilleeney e hirveish, dooyrt Eh, Quoi, ta shiu dy smooinaghtyn mish? Cha nee mish Eh.

"26 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.","Gheiney as vraaraghyn, cloan sheeloghe Abraham, as quoi-erbee ta nyn mast’ eauish goaill aggle roish Jee, hiuish ta goo yn taualtys shoh er ny choyrt.",
"27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.","Son adsyn ta vaghey ec Jerusalem, as ny fir-reïl oc, son nagh hoie ad jehsyn, ny foast jeh coraaghyn ny phadeyryn t’er nyn lhaih dy chooilley ghoonaght, t’ad er chooilleeney ad shen ayns eshyn y gheyrey.

"28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.","As ga nagh dooar ad oyr erbee baaish ayn, ny-yeih ghuee ad er Pilate e vioys y ghoaill.",
"29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.","As tra v’ad er chooilleeney ooilley ny va scruit jeh, ghow ad Eh neose jeh’n villey, as doanluc ad Eh ayns oaie.",
30 But God raised him from the dead :,Agh hrog Jee seose Eh veih ny merriu :,
"31 And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.","As v’eh er ny akin ymmodee dy laghyn lioroosyn haink seose mârish veih Galilee gys Jerusalem, quoi va ny feanishyn echey da’n pobble.",
"32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,","As ta shinyn soilshaghey diu naightyn gerjoilagh ; yn gialdyn va jeant da ny ayraghyn,",
"33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again ; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.","Kys dy vel Jee er chooilleeney eh dooinyn yn chloan oc, ayns dy vel Eh er hroggal seose Yeesey reesht ; myr te myrgeddin scruit ayns yn nah psalm, Oo my vac, jiu ta mee er dty gheddyn.",
"34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.","As mychione dy hrog Eh Eh seose veih ny merriu, as nagh row Eh arragh dy hyndaa gys loauys, dooyrt Eh er yn aght shoh, Verryms diu myghinyn shickyr Ghavid.",
"35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.","Shen-y-fa t’eh gra myrgeddin ayns psalm elley, Cha lig oo da dty Er-casherick loauys y akin.",
"36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption :","Son erreish da David ayns e eash hene v’er hirveish aigney Yee, huit Eh ny chadley, as v’eh er ny oanluckey marish e ayraghyn, as honnick Eh loauys :",
"37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.","Agh eshyn hrog Jee seose reesht, cha vaik Eh loauys.",
"38 ¶Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :"," Toig-jee shiuish er-y-fa shen, gheiney as vraaraghyn, dy nee ny hrooidsyn ta leih peccaghyn er ny phreacheil diu :",
"39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.","As liorishyn ta ooilley ny ta credjal er ny heyrey veih dy chooilley nhee, vow nagh voddagh shiu v’er ny heyrey liorish leigh Voses.",
"40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets ;","Cur-jee twoaie er-y-fa shen, nagh jig shen ny ta loayrit liorish ny phadeyryn erriu, ",
"41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish : for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.","Cur-jee my-ner, shiuish ta soiaghey beg, as gow-jee yindyss jeh’n toyrt-mow eu : son ta mish gobbraghey obbyr ayns ny laghyn eauish, obbyr nagh jean shiu er aght erbee y chredjal, dy beagh eh er ny hoilshaghey diu.",
"42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.","As tra va ny Hewnyn er gholl as y cheeill, ghuee adsyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh dy beagh ny goan shoh er ny phreacheil daue yn nah ghoonaght.",
"43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.","As erreish da sleih ny killagh v’er skeayley, deiyr ymmodee jeh ny Hewnyn, as jeh ny proselyteyn crauee er Paul as Barnabas ; as loayr ad roo, as choyrlee ad ad dy hannaghtyn ayns grayse Yee.",
44 ¶And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.," As yn nah ghoonaght haink faggys yn slane ard-valley cooidjagh dy chlashtyn goo Yee.",
"45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.","Agh tra honnick ny Hewnyn leid y chaglym dy leih, daase ad feer jymmoosagh, as loayr ad noi ny reddyn va Paul dy livrey, cur eddin da, loayrt goan-mollaghtagh.",
"46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.","Eisht daase Paul as Barnabas dunnal, as dooyrt ad, Ve ymmyrchagh goo Yee dy ve hoshiaght er ny phreacheil diuish : agh fakin dy vel shiu cur cooyl rish, as briwnys shiu hene neu-feeu jeh’n vea veayn, cur-my-ner, ta shinyn chyndaa gys ny Ashoonyn-quaagh.",
"47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.","Son shen myr ta’n Chiarn er chur saarey dooin, gra, Ta mee er hoiaghey oo seose dy ve dty hoilshey da ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, as dy ve son saualtys gys ny ardjyn sodjey er y thalloo.",
"48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.","As tra cheayll adsyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh shoh, ghow ad boggey, as ren ad goo yn Chiarn y ghloyraghey : as hyndaa whilleen gys y chredjue as va feeu as aarloo son y vea veayn.",
49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.,As va goo yn Chiarn er ny hoilshaghey magh trooid ooilley yn cheer.,
"50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.","Agh ghreinnee ny Hewnyn ny mraane seyrey va jeh’n chredjue oc, as deiney mooarey yn ard-valley nyn oi oc, as dirree ad seose noi Paul as Barnabas, as deiyr ad ad ass ny ardjyn oc.",

"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.","As haink eh gy kione ayns Iconium, dy jagh ad ny neesht cooidjagh stiagh ayns keeill ny Hewnyn, as dy loayr ad myr shen dy ren earroo mooar chammah jeh ny Hewnyn as jeusyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh credjal.",
"2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.","Agh hug ny Hewnyn nagh hyndaa gys y chredjue adsyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh er nyn doshiaght, as phushoon ad ny aignaghyn oc noi ny braaraghyn.",
"3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.","Ry foddey dy earish er-y-fa shen duirree ad ayns shen loayrt dy foshlit as dy dunnal ayns y Chiarn, ren feanish y ymmyrkey gys goo e ghrayse hene, as yiall cowraghyn as yindyssyn dy ve jeant liorish ny laueyn oc.",
"4 But the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.","Agh va sleih yn ard-valley noi ry hoi : as va ayrn jeu goaill paart ny Hewnyn, as ayrn elley paart ny ostyllyn.",
"5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them,","As tra va chammah adsyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, as myrgeddin ny Hewnyn, marish ny fir-reïl oc, soit er drogh ghellal y chur daue, as nyn glaghey ad,",
"6 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about :","Hooar adsyn fys er, as chosne ad rowe gys Lystra as Derbe, ard-valjyn dy Lycaonia, as gys y cheer mygeayrt :",
7 And there they preached the gospel.,As ayns shen ren ad y sushtal y phreacheil.,
"8 ¶And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked :"," As va ny hoie ec Lystra dooinney dy row, va annoon ayns e chassyn, v’er ny ve croobagh veih breïn e vayrey, cha ren Eh rieau shooyl. ",
"9 The same heard Paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,","Cheayll Eh shoh Paul loayrt ; as yeeagh Paul dy gyere er, as dennee Eh dy row credjue echey dy ve er ny lheihys,",
"10 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.","As dooyrt Eh lesh ard choraa, Shass seose dy jeeragh er dty chassyn. As leïme Eh, as huïll eh.",
"11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.","As tra honnick y pobble cre va Paul er n’yannoo, hrog ad seose nyn goraaghyn, gra ayns glare Lycaonia, Ta ny Jeeaghyn er jeet neose hooin ayns cummey deiney.",
"12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter ; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.","As denmys ad Barnabas Jupiter, as Paul Mercury, er-y-fa dy nee Eh smoo va loayrt. ",
"13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.","Eisht hug saggyrt Jupiter, va cheu-mooie jeh’n ard-valley, lesh dew as lossyreeyn gys ny giattyn, as baillish v’er hebbal oural marish y pobble.",
"14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,","Agh tra cheayll ny ostyllyn, Barnabas as Paul jeh, raip ad nyn eaddagh, as roih ad stiagh mastey’n pobble, geamagh,",
"15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein :","As gra, Gheiney, cre’n-fa ta shiu jannoo ny reddyn shoh?

16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.,"As ayns ny eashyn t’er gholl shiaghey, lig da ooilley ny Ashoonyn-quaagh shooyl ayns nyn raaidyn hene.",
"17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.","Ny-yeih cha daag Eh Eh hene fegooish feanish, ayns dy ren Eh mie, as dy dug Eh dooin fliaghey veih niau, as imbaghyn messoil, lhieeney ny creeaghyn ain lesh beaghey as gennalys.",
"19 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them.","[sic: 18] As lesh ny raaghyn shoh, scoan ren ad y pobble y lhiettal veih oural y hebbal daue.",
"19 ¶And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead."," As haink shiartance dy Hewnyn veih Antioch as Iconium, as chleaynee ad y pobble, as ren ad Paul y chlaghey as y hayrn magh ass yn ard-valley, sheiltyn dy row eh marroo.",
"20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.","Ny-yeih myr v’adsyn va jeh’n chredjue nyn shassoo mygeayrt y mysh, dirree Eh seose as haink Eh stiagh ayns yn ard-valley : as yn nah laa hie Eh marish Barnabas gys Derbe.",
"21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,","As tra v’ad er phreacheil y sushtal gys yn ard-valley shen, as er n’ynsaghey ymmodee, haink ad reesht gys Lystra, as gys Iconium as Antioch,",
"22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.","Niartaghey anmeenyn ny Creesteenyn, as coyrlaghey ad dy hannaghtyn ayns y chredjue, as dy nhegin dooin trooid ymmodee seaghyn goll stiagh ayns reeriaght Yee.",
"23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.","As tra v’ad er hoiaghey er-lheh shirveishee ayns dy chooilley cheeill, as er ghoaill padjer lesh trostey, ren ad y hymney ad gys y Chiarn, ayn v’ad er chredjal.",
"24 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.","As tra v’ad er gholl harrish ooilley Pisidia, haink ad gys Pamphylia.",
"25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia :","As erreish daue v’er phreacheil y goo ayns Perga, hie ad sheese gys Attalia :",
"26 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.","As veih shen ghow ad luingys gys Antioch, voish v’ad er ny ve chymnit gys grayse Yee, son yn obbyr ren ad y chooilleeney.",
"27 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.","As tra v’ad er jeet, as er n’eamagh er yn agglish cooidjagh, hug ad coontey daue jeh ooilley ny va Jee er n’yannoo roo, as kys v’eh er vosley dorrys y chredjue da ny Ashoonyn-quaagh.",
28 And there they abode long time with the disciples.,"As duirree ad ry foddey dy earish ayns shen, maroosyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue. ",
,CAB. XV.,
"And certain men which came down from Judea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.","As dynsee shiartance dy gheiney haink neose veih Judea ny braaraghyn, gra, Mannagh bee shiu er nyn yiarey chymmylt lurg aght Voses, cha vod shiu v’er nyn sauail.",
"2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.","Tra va streeu er-y-fa shen as resooney nagh nee beggan er ve ec Paul as Barnabas roo, ghow ad ayns laue dy ragh Paul as Barnabas, as shiartance elley mâroo, seose gys Jerusalem gys ny ostyllyn as y chanstyr mychione y question shoh.",
"3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.","As hie yn agglish magh mâroo dy chur ad er nyn doshiaght er nyn yurnah, as jimmee ad trooid Phenice as Samaria, soilshaghey chyndaa ny Ashoonyn-quaagh gys y chredjue : as va shoh oyr boggey mooar da ooilley ny braaraghyn.",
"4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.","As tra v’ad er jeet gys Jerusalem, hooar ad oltaghey bea veih’n agglish, as veih ny ostylyn as y chanstyr, as hug ad coontey jeh dy chooilley nhee va Jee er n’yannoo roo.",
"15 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.","As dirree seose shiartance jeh ny Phariseeyn v’er jyndaa gys y chredjue, as dooyrt ad, Dy row eh ymmyrchagh ad y yiarey chymmylt, as saarey chur daue ad dy reaylley leigh Voses.",
6 ¶And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.," As haink ny ostyllyn as y chanstyr cooidjagh dy reaghey yn chooish shoh.",
"7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.","As erreish daue v’er ve foddey resooney, dirree Peddyr seose, as dooyrt Eh roo, Gheiney as vraaraghyn, ta fys eu foddey er dy henney, dy ren Jee reih y yannoo nyn mast’ ain, dy row ny Ashoonyn-quaagh veih my veeal’s dy chlashtyn goo yn sushtal, as dy chredjal.",
"8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us ;","Agh dymmyrk Jee, echey ta fys cre t’ayns ny creeaghyn, feanish lhieu, as hug Eh daue yn Spyrryd Noo, myr hug Eh dooinyn.",
"9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.","As cha dug Eh scarrey erbee eddyr adsyn as shinyn, glenney ny creeaghyn oc liorish credjue.",
"10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?","Kys er-y-fa shen dy vel shiu nish brasnaghey Jee, liorish quing y choyrt er y wannal ocsyn ta jeh’n chredjue, nagh row ny ayraghyn ain ny shin hene abyl y ymmyrkey?",
"11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.","Agh ta shin credjal trooid grayse nyn Jiarn Yeesey Creest, dy bee mad er nyn sauail, er yn un aght as vees adsyn.",
"12 ¶Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them."," Eisht va ooilley yn cheshaght nyn dost, as deaisht ad rish Barnabas as Paul soilshaghey cre ny mirrillyn as ny yindyssyn va Jee er n’obbraghey mastey ny Ashoonyn-quaagh lioroosyn.",
"13 ¶And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me :"," As erreish daue v’er chummal nyn jengey, dreggyr Jamys, gra, Gheiney as vraaraghyn, eaisht-jee rhym’s.",
"14 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.","Ta Simeon er hoilshaghey kys ren Jee ec y toshiaght jeeaghyn er ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, dy ghoaill assdoo pobble son yn ennym echey.",
"15 And to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written,","As rish shoh ta cordail goan ny phadeyryn ; myr te scruit,",
"16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down ; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up :","Ny lurg shoh higgyms reesht, as troggym as yn noa cabbane-agglish Ghavid, ta er duittym ; as troggym eh reesht erreish da v’er gholl naardey, as soie-ym eh seose :",
"17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.","Dy vod y Chiarn v’er ny hirrey magh liorish y chooid elley jeh ny deiney, as liorish ooilley ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, orroo ta my ennym er ny enmyss, ta’n Chiarn gra, ta jannoo dy chooilley nhee jeu shoh.",
18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.,"Ec Jee ta fys er ooilley e obbraghyn hene, er dy hoshiaght y theihll.",
"19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God :","Shen-y-fa my vriwnys’s eh, gyn shin dy heaghnaghey adsyn ta veih mastey ny Ashoonyn-quaagh er jyndaa gys Jee :",
"20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.","Agh shin dy scrieu huc, ad dy reaylley ad hene veih broïd jallooyn, as veih maarderys, as veih reddyn toghtit, as veih fuill.",
"21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.","Son ta ec Moses er dyn chen earish, ayns dy chooilley ard-valley adsyn ta dy phreacheil Eh, as t’eh er ny lhaih ayns ny kialteenyn dy chooilley ghoonaght.",
"22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren :","Eisht yeeagh ny ostyllyn as y chanstyr, as y slane agglish er dy ve ymmyrchagh, dy chur deiney reiht jeh’n cheshaght oc hene gys Antioch, marish Paul as Barnabas, ta shen dy ghra, Judas slennooit Barsabas, as Silas, ard deiney mastey ny braaraghyn :",
23 And they wrote letters by them after this manner ; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.,"As scrieu ad screeuyn lhieu er yn aght shoh, Ta ny ostyllyn, as y chanstyr, as ny braaraghyn cur bannaght gys ny braaraghyn ta jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh ayns Antioch, as Syria as Cilicia.",
"24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :","Son wheesh as dy vel shin er chlashtyn, dy vel shiartance hie magh voinyn er ny heaghnaghey shiu lesh goan, seih nyn anmeenyn, as gra, dy nhegin diu v’er nyn yiarey chymmylt, as y leigh y reaylley ; daue cha dug shinyn leid y saarey :",
"25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,","Ta shinyn, ta lesh un aigney er nyn jaglym cooidjagh, er vakin eh fit, dy chur deiney reiht hiuish, marish nyn mraaraghyn graihagh Barnabas as Paul ;",
26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.,Deiney veagh er scarrey rish nyn mioys son ennym nyn Jiarn Yeesey Creest.,
"27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.","Ta shin er-y-fa shen er chur hiu Judas as Silas, nee ny reddyn cheddin y insh diu.",
"28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;","Son te er ny akin fit liorish yn Spyrryd Noo, as liorinyn, gyn errey smoo y chur erriu na ny reddyn ymmyrchagh shoh ;",
"29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.","Shiu dy reaylley shiu hene veih beeghyn va chebbit gys jallooyn, as veih fuill, as veih reddyn toghtit, as veih maarderys : vow shoh my reaillys shiu shiu hene, nee shiu dy mie.

"30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle :","Myr shen tra v’ad er lhiggey yn raad daue, haink ad gys Antioch : as cha leah as va’n cheshaght er nyn jaglym cooidjagh, livrey ad ny screeuyn.",
"31 Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.",As lhaih ad ee lesh boggey as gerjagh mooar.,
"32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.","As myr va Judas as Silas nyn vadeyryn ad hene, choyrlee ad ny braaraghyn lesh ymmodee goan, as hickyree ad ad ayns nyn gredjue.",
"33 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.","As erreish daue v’er vuirriaght ayns shen son earish, lig ny braaraghyn y raad daue gys ny ostyllyn ayns shee.",
34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.,Ny-yeih she aigney Silas ve dy uirriaght ayns shen.,
"35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.","Duirree Paul myrgeddin as Barnabas ayns Antioch, gynsaghey as preacheil goo yn Chiarn, marish ymmodee elley.",
"36 ¶And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do."," As laghyn ny lurg shen dooyrt Paul rish Barnabas, Lig dooin goll reesht dy yeeaghyn nyn mraaraghyn ayns dy chooilley ard-valley, raad ta shin er phreacheil goo yn Chiarn, dy yeeaghyn kys t’ad.",
"37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.","As va Barnabas booiagh Ean y chur lhieu mâroo, va slennooit Mark.",
"38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.","Agh dob Paul nagh ragh Eh mâroo, son dy daag Eh ad ec Pamphylia, as nagh jagh Eh mâroo gys yn obbyr.",
"39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus ;","As dirree leid y streeu shen eddyr ad, dy scarr ad ry cheïley : as hug Barnabas lesh Mark, as ghow Eh luingys gys Cyprus.",
"40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.","As reih Paul Silas, as jimmee Eh roish, erreish da v’er ny hymney gys grayse Yee liorish ny braaraghyn.",
"41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.","As huïll Eh trooid Syria as Cilicia, niartaghey ny kialteenyn ayns nyn gredjue.",
,CAB. XVI.,
"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra : and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed ; but his father was a Greek :","Eisht haink Eh gys Derbe as Lystra : as cur-my-ner, va dooinney dy row jeh’n chredjue ayns shen, va enmyssit Timothy, mac ben dy row v’er ve ny Hew, as ren chyndaa gys y chredjue ; agh va’n ayr echey jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh :",
2 Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.,Va goo-mie ec Timothy shoh veih ny braaraghyn va ec Lystra as Iconium.,
3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek.,"As eshyn ballish Paul dy gholl magh mârish ; as ghow Eh as ren Eh Eh y yiarey chymmylt, kyndagh rish ny Hewnyn v’ayns ny ardjyn shen : son va fys oc ooilley dy row e ayr jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh.",
"4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.",As myr v’ad goll trooid ny ard-valjyn livrey ad daue ny oardaghyn dy reaylley v’er nyn goyrt magh liorish ny ostyllyn as y chanstyr va ec Jerusalem.,
"5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.","As shen myr va ny kialteenyn er nyn niartaghey ayns y chredjue, as er nyn mishaghey ayns earroo gagh laa.",
"6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,","Nish tra v’ad er gholl trooid Phrygia, as cheer Galatia, hug y Spyrryd Noo currym daue gyn ad dy phreacheil y goo ayns Asia,",
"7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not.","As erreish daue v’er jeet gys Mysia, heb ad dy gholl er nyn doshiaght gys Bithynia : agh cha lig y Spyrryd daue.",
8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.,"Myr shen hie ad shiaghey Mysia, as haink ad neose gys Troas.",
"9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.","As honnick Paul ashlish ayns yn oie ; Hass dooinney jeh Macedonia liorish, as ghuee Eh er, gra, Tarr noon gys Macedonia, as cooin lhien.",
"10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them.","As erreish da v’er vakin yn ashlish ghow shin ayns laue chelleeragh dy ragh shin gys Macedonia, goaill ain hene ayns shickyrys dy row yn Chiarn er n’eamagh orrin dy phreacheil y sushtal daue.",
"11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis ;","Shen-y-fa ghow deashil shin veih Troas, as haink shin lesh coorse jeeragh gys Samothracia, as yn nah laa gys Neapolis ;",
"12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days.","As veih shen gys Philippi, yn ard-valley by voo v’ayns yn ayrn shen jeh Macedonia, as bentyn gys y Raue : as duirree shin ayns yn ard-valley shen shiartance dy laghyn.",
"13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.","As er laa’n doonaght hie shin magh ass y valley, gys boayl va lowit son padjer, rish oirr ny hawin ; as hoie shin sheese, as loayr shin rish ny mraane v’er nyn jaglym cooidjagh.",
"14 ¶And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us : whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul."," As va ben dy row enmyssit Lydia, va jeh ard-valley Thyatira, as creck gorrym-jiarg, v’ee shoh cur ooashley da Jee, as deaisht ee rooin : as doshil yn Chiarn y cree eck, dy dug ee geill da ny va Paul dy loayrt.",
"15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.","As tra v’ee hene as lught e thie er nyn mashtey, ghuee ee orrin, gra, My ta shiu er vriwnys mish dy ve firrinagh gys y Chiarn, tarr-jee stiagh as fuirree-jee ayns my hie. As cha goghe ee obbal voïn.",
"16 ¶And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying :"," As haink eh gy kione, myr va shin goll gys y boayl va lowit son padjer, dy daink ben-aeg dy row nyn guail, ayn-jee va spyrryd dy aishnagh, as v’ee cur ymmodee cosney da ny mainshtyryn eck, liorish ny reddyn v’ee dy insh : ",
"17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.","Deiyr ee shoh er Paul as orrinyn, geamagh as gra, Ny deiney shoh sharvaantyn y Jee smoo ard, ta soilshaghey dooin raad y taualtys.",
"18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.","As shoh ren ee ry ymmodee dy laghyn. Agh va Paul jymmoosagh, as hyndaa Eh, as dooyrt Eh rish y spyrryd, Ta mee cur currym ort ayns ennym Yeesey Creest oo dy heet magh ass-jee. As haink eh magh yn oor cheddin.",
"19 ¶And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,"," As tra honnick ny mainshtyryn eck nagh row ad dy yerkal rish arragh dy chosney lioree, haare ad Paul as Silas, as hayrn ad ad gys y whaiyl, fenish fir-reïl yn ard-valley,",
"20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,","Eisht hug ad lhieu ad gys ny fir-reïl va veih’n Raue, gra, Ta ny deiney shoh er ghoostey ymmodee anvea ayns yn ard-valley ain, liorish dy nee Hewnyn ad,",
"21 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.","As dy vel ad cur magh oardaghyn nagh vel lowit dooinyn, ta bentyn gys y Raue, dy ghoaill orrin, ny dy reaylley.",
"22 And the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.","As dirree yn pobble magh nyn oi : as raip ny fir-reïl nyn eaddagh, as hug ad saarey ad dy ve er nyn mwoalley lesh slattyn.",
"23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely :","As tra v’ad er chur ymmodee buillaghyn daue, hilg ad ad ayns pryssoon, as hug ad saarey dasyn va currym y phryssoon er, Eh dy reaylley ad dy sauchey ; ",
"24 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.","Quoi, liorish dy row leid y saarey er ny chur da, hilg ad ayns y phryssoon bodjey stiagh, as hug ny cassyn oc dy shickyr ayns ny stockyn.",
"25 ¶And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God : and the prisoners heard them."," Agh ec main-oie ghow Paul as Silas padjer as arraneyn moyllee gys Jee : as cheayll ny pryssoonee ad.",
"26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.","As ayns y tullogh va craa mooar thallooin ayn, myr shen dy row undinyn y phryssoon er nyn graa : as chelleeragh va ooilley ny dorryssyn er nyn vosley, as kianglaghyn dy chooilley annane er nyn veaysley.",
"27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.","As ghooisht eshyn va currym y phryssoon er ass e chadley, as tra honnick Eh dorryssyn y phryssoon foshlit, hayrn Eh e chliwe, as ballish v’er varroo Eh hene, goaill ayns laue dy row ny pryssoonee er chosney rowe.",
"28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm : for we are all here.","Agh deïe Paul lesh ard choraa, gra, Ny jean aggair erbee dhyt hene ; son ta shin ooilley ayns shoh.",
"29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,","Eisht deïe Eh son soilshey, as hie Eh stiagh, as huit Eh sheese er-creau kiongoyrt rish Paul as Silas ;",
"30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?","As hug Eh lesh ad magh, as dooyrt Eh, Gheiney mie, cre shegin dooys y yannoo dy voddym v’er my hauail? ",
"31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.","As dooyrt ad, Cred ayns y Chiarn Yeesey Creest, as bee oo hene as dty hie er nyn sauail.",
"32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.","As loayr ad goo yn Chiarn rishyn, as rish ooilley ny va ayns e hie.",
"33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes ; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.","As ghow Eh ad yn oor cheddin jeh’n oie, as niee Eh ny lottyn oc ; as v’eh hene as ooilley lught e hie er nyn mashtey chelleeragh.",

"35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.","As tra va’n laa ayn, hug ny fir-reïl ny fir-oik va foue, gra, Lig ny deiney shen magh.",
"36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go : now therefore depart, and go in peace.","As dinsh eshyn va currym y phryssoon yn raa shoh da Paul, Ta ny fir-reïl er chur fys dy lhiggey yn raad diu : gow-jee nish er-y-fa shen magh, as immee-jee reue ayns shee.",
"37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily ; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.","Agh dooyrt Paul roo, T’ad er nyn mwoalley shinyn, ta bentyn gys y Raue, dy foshlit as fegooish v’er nyn mriwnys, as er hilgey shin ayns pryssoon ; as vel ad nish dyn eiyrt shin magh dy follit? cha bee eh myr shen ayns firrinys ; agh lig daue hene cheet as shin y chur lhieu magh.",

"40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia : and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.","As tra v’adsyn er jeet ass y phryssoon, hie ad stiagh ayns thie Lydia : as erreish daue v’er vakin ny braaraghyn, ren ad y gherjaghey ad, as jimmee ad roue.",

"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews :","Nish tra v’ad er gholl trooid Amphipolis as Apollonia, haink ad gys Thessalonica, raad va keeill ec ny Hewnyn.",
"2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,","As hie Paul, myr va’n cliaghtey echey stiagh huc, as son three doonaghtyn ren Eh resooney roo ass ny scriptyryn,",
"3 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead ; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.","Cur tushtey daue as soiaghey roue dy beign da Cresst v’er hurranse, as v’er n’irree veih ny merriu : as dy nee Yeesey shoh ta mish dy phreacheil diu, yn Creest.

"5 ¶But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people."," Agh hie ny Hewnyn nagh hyndaa gys y chredjue son troo moo, as ghow ad huc shiartance dy ghrogh gheiney as dy vee-reiltee ; as tra va chaglym mooar jeu oc, voiyr ad ooilley yn ard-valley, as hie ad stiagh er niart ayns thie Jason, shirrey ad y choyrt lhieu magh gys y pobble.",
"6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also ;","As tra nagh dooar ad ad, hayrn ad lhieu Jason as shiartance jeh ny braaraghyn gys fir-reïl yn ard-valley, geamagh, T’ad shoh t’er hyndaa yn seihll bun rish skyn er jeet ayns shoh neesht ;",

"8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.","As va ooilley yn pobble as fir-reïl yn ard-valley ayns imnea mooar, tra cheayll ad ny reddyn shoh.",
"9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.","As tra v’ad er ghoaill raanteenyn son Jason as y vooinjer elley, lhig ad y raad daue.",
10 ¶And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.," As hug ny braaraghyn ersooyl chelleeragh Paul as Silas ayns yn oie gys Berea : as tra v’ad er jeet gys shen, hie ad stiagh ayns keeill ny Hewnyn.",
"17 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.","V’ad shoh ny s’fudee na ny Thessalonianee, ayns dy deaisht ad rish y goo lesh dy chooilley arryltys aigney, as hir ad magh ny scriptyryn gagh laa, nee shen myr va ny reddyn shen.",
"12 Therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.","Shen-y-fa ren ymmodee jeu credjal : as myrgeddin dy vraane ooasle va nyn Greekyn, as dy gheiney.",
"13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.","Agh tra hooar Hewnyn Thessalonica fys dy row Paul er phreacheil goo Yee ec Berea, haink ad derrey shen, as ghreinnee ad yn pobble n’oi.",
14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.,"Er shen hug ny braaraghyn Paul chelleeragh, myr dy beagh Eh dy gholl son y cheayin : agh duirree Silas as Timothy ayns shen.",
"15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.","As hug y vooinjer hie marish Paul lhieu Eh gys Athens : as erreish daue v’er gheddyn saarey gys Silas as Timothy dy heet huggey lesh dy chooilley hiyr, jimmee ad rowe.",
"16 ¶Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry."," Nish choud as va Paul farkiaght son y cheet oc ec Athens, v’eh seaghnit ayns e aigney, tra honnick Eh ooilley yn ard-valley laane jallooyn.",
"17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.","Shen-y-fa ren Eh resooney ayns y cheeill rish ny Hewnyn, as rish ny deiney crauee, as ayns y vargey gagh laa roosyn va cheet ny raad.",
"18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods : because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.","Eisht hoie shiartance jeh fir-ynsee ny Epicureanee as ny Stoickyn er : as dooyrt paart jeu, Cre ballish shoh ta goaill wheesh dy haggloo er y ghra?

"19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?","As ghow ad, as hug ad lhieu Eh gys Areopagus, gra, Vod mad fys y gheddyn cre’n ynsagh noa shoh tow uss dy chur magh? ",

"22 ¶Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious."," Eisht hass Paul seose ayns main Areopagus, as dooyrt Eh, Gheiney Athens, Heeym dy vel er dy chooilley aght rouyr fardail ayns y chraueeaght eu. ",

"24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;","Jee ren y seihll, as dy chooilley nhee t’ayn y chroo, fakin dy nee Chiarn niau as thalloo Eh, cha vel Eh vaghey ayns chiambyllyn ta troggit lesh laueyn :",
"25 Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things ;","Cha-moo ta ooashley er ny chur da lesh laueyn deiney, myr dy beagh feme echey er nhee erbee, fakin dy vel Eh coyrt da ooilley bioys, as ennal, as dy chooilley nhee ;",
"26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation ;","As dy hrog Eh seose jeh’n un uill ooilley ashoonyn sheelnaue, dy chur orroo vaghey er ooilley eaghtyr y thallooin, as dy vel Eh er n’oardaghey ny earishyn v’eh roie er ny hoiaghy, as ardjyn ny ynnydyn-vaghee oc :",
"27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us :","Dy voddagh ad y Chiarn y hirrey, my haghyragh daue briaght er e hon, as y gheddyn magh Eh, ga nagh vel Eh foddey veih dy chooilley annane ain :",
"28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.","Son aynsyn ta shin bio, as gleashaght, as beaghey ; myr ta paart jeh ny poetyn eu hene er ghra, Son she jehsyn myrgeddin haink shin.",
"29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.","Son wheesh eisht as dy nee jeh Jee haink shin, cha lhisagh shin smooinaghtyn dy vel y Dooghys-Jee goll-rish aihr, ny argid, ny clagh obbyrit lesh keeal as shleie dooinney.

30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :,"As son earishyn y vee-hushtey shoh, cha ghow Jee kerraghey ; agh nish t’eh cur saarey da dy chooilley ghooinney ayns dy chooilley ynnyd arrys y ghoaill :",
"31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.","Er-y-fa dy vel Eh er hoiaghey laa ry hoi yn seihll y vriwnys ayns cairys, liorish y dooinney shen t’eh er ny phointeil ; as jeh shoh t’eh er chur shickyrys da dy chooilley ghooinney, ayns dy vel Eh er hroggal Eh veih ny merriu.",
"32 ¶And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked : and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter."," As tra cheayll ad jeh irree-seose-reesht ny merriu, ren paart craidey : as dooyrt cooid elley jeu, Eaishtee mad rhyt keayrt elley mychione shen.",
33 So Paul departed from among them.,Myr shen jimmee Paul veih nyn mast’ oc.,
"34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed : among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.","Ny-yeih ren shiartance dy gheiney lhiantyn huggey, as credjal : nyn mast’ ocsyn va Dionysius yn Areopagite, as ben va enmyssit Damaris, as feallagh elley mâroo.",

"After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth ;","Ny lurg shoh jimmee Paul veih Athens, as haink eh gys Corinth :",
"2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla ; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome :) and came unto them.","As hooar Eh Hew dy row va enmyssit Aquila, ruggyr ayns Pontus, va er ny laghyn shen er jeet veih Italy, as e ven Priscilla mârish (er-y-fa dy row Claudius er haarey ooilley ny Hewnyn dy gholl ass y Raue) as haink Eh huc.",
"3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers.","As er-yn-oyr dy row Eh jeh’n un cheird roo, duirree Eh as dobbree Eh mâroo (son jannoo-cabbaneyn va’n cheird oc)",
"4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.","As v’eh resooney ayns y cheeill dy chooilley ghoonaght, as coyrlaghey ny Hewnyn as ny Greekyn.",
"5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.","As tra va Silas as Timothy er jeet veih Macedonia, daase Paul jeean ayns spyrryd, as dymmyrk Eh feanish gys ny Hewnyn dy nee Yeesey va yn Creest.",
"6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads ; I am clean ; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.","Agh tra v’ad er hoiaghey ad hene n’oi, as er loayrt goan mollaghtagh, chrie Eh e choamrey, as dooyrt Eh roo, Yn uill eu dy row er ny king eu hene ; Ta mish neu-chyndagh : veih shoh magh hem roym gys ny Ashoonyn-quaagh.",
"7 ¶And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue."," As jimmee Eh veih shen, as hie Eh stiagh ayns thie dooinney dy row va cur ooashley da Jee, va enmyssit Justus, va’n thie echey er-gerrey da’n cheeill.",
"8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.","As ren Crispus ard fer-reïl ny killagh, credjal ayns y Chiarn, as ooilley e hie : as va ymmodee jeh ny Corinthianee ren clashtyn as credjal, er nyn mashtey.",
"9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace :","Eisht loayr y Chiarn ayns ashlish rish Paul ayns yn oie, Ny gow aggle, agh loayr, as ny cum dty hengey :",
"10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee : for I have much people in this city.","Son ta mish mârt, as cha soie dooinney erbee ort dy yannoo aggair dhyt : son ta sleih dy mie aym’s ayns yn ard-valley shoh.",
"11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","As duirree Eh ayns shen three bleeaney as lieh vlein, gynsaghey goo Yee nyn mast’ oc.",
"12 ¶And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,"," As tra va Gallio reill ayns Achaia, ren ny Hewnyn girree magh lesh un aigney noi Paul, as hug ad lhieu Eh gys stoyl y vriwnys,",
"13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.","Gra, T’eh shoh coyrlaghey sleih dy chur ooashley da Jee noi yn leigh.",
"14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you :","As tra va Paul goll dy osley e veeal, dooyrt Gallio rish ny Hewnyn, Dy beagh eh cooish dy aggair, ny dy ghrogh yannoo, veagh eh resoonagh, O Ewnyn, mee dy ymmyrkey lhieu :",
"15 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it ; for I will be no judge of such matters.","Agh my she streeu eh son focklyn as en’myn, as mychione y leigh eu, jeeagh-jee hene da ; son cha beem’s my vriw ayns leid ny cooishyn.",
16 And he drave them from the judgment seat.,As deiyr Eh ad veih stoyl y vriwnys.,
"17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.","Eisht ghow ooilley ny Greekyn Sosthenes, ard fer-reïl ny killagh, as woail ad Eh kiongoyrt rish stoyl y vriwnys : as cha dug Gallio veg y yeill da ny reddyn shen.",
"18 ¶And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila ; having shorn his head in Cenchrea : for he had a vow."," As duirree Paul ayns shen ymmodee dy laghyn, as eisht daag Eh bannaght ec ny braaraghyn, as hiauil Eh veih shen gys Syria, as mârish va Priscilla as Aquila, v’er vaarey e chione ec Cenchrea ; son v’eh fo breearrey.",

"20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not ;","Tra v’ad geearree Eh dy uirriaght ny sodjey mâroo, cha neaishtagh Eh roo :",
"21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem : but I will return again unto you, if God will.

"27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him : who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace :","As tra v’eh aignagh dy ghoaill jurnah gys Achaia, scrieu ny braaraghyn, as choyrlee ad ny Creesteenyn dy oltaghey e vea : as erreish da v’er jeet, hug Eh dy mie er nyn doshiaght adsyn v’er chredjal trooid grayse.",
"28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.","Son resoon Eh dy pooaral rish ny Hewnyn, kiongoyrt rish y pobble, soilshaghey liorish ny scriptyryn, dy nee Yeesey va’n Creest.",
,CAB. XIX.,
"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus : and finding certain disciples,","As haink eh gy kione, choud as va Apollos ec Corinth, dy jagh Paul trooid ny ardjyn syrjey, derrey haink Eh gys Ephesus : as hooar Eh shiartance jeusyn va jeh’n chredjue.",

"4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.","Eisht dooyrt Paul, Vaisht Ean dy firrinagh lesh bashtey arrys, gra rish y pobble, Ad dy chredjal aynsyn harragh ny yei, ta shen, ayns Creest Yeesey.",
"5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","Tra cheayll ad shen, v’ad er nyn mashtey ayns ennym y Chiarn Yeesey.",
"6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.","As tra va Paul er chur e laueyn orroo, haink y Spyrryd Noo orroo ; as loayr ad lesh chengaghyn, as ren ad phadeyrys.",
7 And all the men were about twelve.,As va ooilley ny deiney mysh ghaa yeig.,

"9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.","Agh tra ren shiartance jeu creoghey, as ayns ynnyd chyndaa gys y chredjue, loayrt dy holk jeh’n raad shen kiongoyrt rish y pobble, hug Eh cooyl roo, as tra v’eh er scarrey adsyn v’er chredjal vow, dynsee Eh ad gagh laa ayns schoill fer va enmyssit Tyrannus.",

"12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.","Myr shen dy dug ad lhieu veih’n chorp echey gys sleih chingey, bussellyn as apronyn, as hooar ad rea rish ny doghanyn oc, as hie ny drogh spyrrydyn magh assdoo.",
"13 ¶Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth."," Eisht ren shiartance jeh ny Hewnyn va goll mygeayrt tilgey magh drogh-spyrrydyn, goaill orroo dy eamagh harrish y vooinjer va drogh spyrrydyn ayndoo, ennym y Chiarn Yeesey, gra, Ta shin cur currym erriu liorish Yeesey ta Paul dy phreacheil.",
"14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.","As va shiaght meck da Sceva, Hew, ard saggyrt ren shen.",
"15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know ; but who are ye?","As dreggyr y drogh spyrryd as dooyrt eh, Yeesey shione dou, as Paul ta enney aym er ; agh quoi shiuish?",
"16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.","As leïme y dooinney ayn va’n drogh spyrryd orroo, as hooar Eh yn varriaght as laue yn eaghtyr harrystoo, myr shen dy chosne ad rowe ass y thie shen rooisht as broojit.",
"17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus ; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.","As hooar ooilley ny Hewnyn, as adsyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh va vaghey ec Ephesus fys er shoh ; as haink aggle orroo ooilley, as va ard-voylley er ny choyrt da ennym y Chiarn Yeesey.",
"18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.","As haink ymmodee jeusyn v’er chredjal, as ghow ad rish, as hoilshee ad magh nyn obbraghyn.",
"19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.","Ren ymmodee myrgeddin jeusyn va cur rish obbeeyn, nyn lhioaryn y chur lhieu cooidjagh, as losht ad ad kiongoyrt rish dy chooilley ghooinney : as hilg ad seose y phrice oc, as hooar ad eh dy ve jeih thousaneyn as da-eed dy pheeshyn dy argid.",
20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.,Cha breeoil shen ren goo Yee bishaghey as raad y ghoaill.,
"21 ¶After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome."," Tra va ny reddyn shoh ec kione, chiare Paul ayns y spyrryd, tra veagh Eh er gholl trooid Macedonia as Achaia, dy ragh Eh gys Jerusalem, gra, Erreish dou ve ayns shen, shegin dou myrgeddin yn Raue y akin.",
"22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.","Myr shen hug Eh gys Macedonia jees jeh ny shirveishee echey, Timothy as Erastus ; agh duirree Eh hene ayns Asia son earish.",
23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.,As ec y traa cheddin va boirey nagh nee beggan mychione y raad shen.,
"24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;","Son va gaue-argid dy row, va enmyssit Demetrius, va jannoo chambyllyn argid son Diana, as cur cosney nagh nee beggan gys ny fir-chyrjey ;",
"25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.","Roo shoh, tra v’eh er n’eamagh orroo cooidjagh marish ny obbreeyn va bentyn rish y cheird cheddin, dooyrt Eh, Gheiney mie, ta fys eu dy nee liorish y cheird shoh ta nyn merchys ain :",
"26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands :","As ta shiu fakin as clashtyn, dy vel Paul shoh, cha nee ynrycan ec Ephesus, agh faggys trooid ooilley Asia, er choyrlaghey as er hayrn ersooyl ymmodee dy leih, gra, nagh nee Jee’ghyn ad ta jeant lesh laueyn :",
"27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought ; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.","Myr shen dy vel, cha nee ny lomarcan yn cheird shoh ain ayns dangere dy ve mee-lowit ; agh myrgeddin chiamble yn ven-jee mooar Diana dy ve beg soit jeh, as yn ard-ooashley eck dy ve er ny stroie, jee ta ooilley Asia, as y seihll cur ooashley.",
"28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Tra cheayll ad shoh, daase ad feer jymmoosagh, as deïe ad, gra, Mooar ta Diana ny Ephesianee.",
"29 And the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.","As va ooilley yn ard-valley bun rish skyn : as erreish daue v’er ghoaill Gaius as Aristarchus, Macedonianee, sheshaghyn Paul ayns y troailt echey, ying ad lesh un aigney stiagh ayns y theater.",
"30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.","As tra va Paul aignagh dy gholl stiagh gys y pobble, cha lig adsyn va jeh’n chredjue da.",
"31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.","As hug shiartance jeh deiney mooarey Asia, va ny caarjyn echey, fys huggey, geearree gyn Eh dy hreishteil Eh hene ayns y theater.",
"32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another : for the assembly was confused : and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.","Deïe paart er-y-fa shen un red, as paart red elley : son va’n chaglym bun rish skyn, as cha row fys ec yn ayrn smoo jeu cre’n-fa v’ad er nyn jaglym cooidjagh.",
"33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.","As hayrn ad Alexander magh ass y cheshaght, as deiyr ny Hewnyn roue Eh. As chrie Alexander lesh e laue, as ballish v’er loayrt ass e lieh hene rish y pobble.",
"34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.","Agh tra hooar ad fys dy nee Hew v’eh, deïe ad ooilley lesh un choraa choud as daa oor, Mooar ta Diana ny Ephesianee.",
"35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?","As tra va cleragh y valley er chur y pobble gys fea, dooyrt Eh, Gheiney Ephesus, quoi’n dooinney nagh vel fys echey dy vel ard-valley ny Ephesianee cur ooashley da’n ven-jee mooar Diana, as da’n jalloo huit neose veih Jupiter?",
"36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.","Fakin eisht nagh vod ny reddyn shoh ve loayrit noi, lhisagh shiu ve fea-agh, as gyn nhee erbee y yannoo er vullagh ching.",

"38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies : let them implead one another.","Shen-y-fa my ta ec Demetrius, as ny fir-chyrjey ta mârish, playnt noi dooinney erbee, ta ny quaiyllyn nyn soie, as briwnyn ayndoo, ry hoi reaghey chur daue.",

"40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.","Son ta shin ayns dangere dy bee irree-magh er ny choyrt nyn lieh son ny ta jeant jiu ; liorish nagh vel oyr erbee ain dy chur stiagh, dy chur resoon son leid y meeiteil sleih.

"41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.","As tra v’eh er ghra shoh, lig Eh yn raad da’n pobble.",

"And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.","As erreish da’n irree-magh shoh ve ec fea, deïe Paul orroosyn v’er chredjal huggey, as daag Eh bannaght oc, as jimmee Eh roish dy gholl gys Macedonia",

"7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight.","As er y chied laa jeh’n chaghtin, tra va shin er jeet cooidjagh dy vrishey arran, ren Paul preacheil daue, as myr v’eh dy gholl roish laa ny vairagh, chum Eh loayrt derrey main-oie.",

"9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.","As va dooinney aeg dy row, va enmyssit Eutychus, ny hoie ayns uinniag, as huit Eh ny chadley dy trome : as myr va Paul foddey preacheil, skyr Eh sheese ayns e chadley, as huit Eh neose jeh’n tress lout, as v’eh er ny hroggal marroo.",

"11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.","Tra v’eh er-y-fa shen er jeet seose reesht, as er vrishey arran, as er n’ee, as er daggloo foddey, dys eer brishey yn laa, jimmee Eh roish.",

"28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help : This is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place : and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.","Geamagh, Gheiney Israel, cooin-jee lhien : shoh’n dooinney ta gynsaghey dy chooilley ghooinney, ayns dy chooilley ynnyd noi yn pobble, as y leigh, as y boayl shoh ; as ny sodjey na shen, t’eh er chur lesh deiney jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh stiagh ayns y chiamble, as er villey yn ynnyd casherick shoh.",
"29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)","(Son v’ad roie er vakin mârish ayns yn ard-valley, Trophimus, Ephesian, as heïll ad dy row Paul er chur lesh Eh stiagh ayns y chiamble.)",
"30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together : and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut.","As va ooilley yn ard-valley neu-aashagh, as roih yn pobble cooidjagh : as ghow ad Paul, as hayrn ad Eh magh ass y chiamble ; as chelleeragh va ny dorryssyn er nyn yeigh.",

"32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul.","As ghow Eh chelleeragh sidooryn as captanyn-keead, as roie Eh sheese huc : as tra honnick ad yn ard chaptan as ny sidooryn, scuir ad veih bwoalley Paul.",
"33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.","Eisht haink yn ard chaptan er-gerrey, as ghow Eh Eh, as doardee Eh Eh dy ve kainlt lesh daa yeuley ; as dênee Eh quoi v’eh, as cre v’eh er n’yannoo.",
"34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.","As deïe paart un red, as paart red elley mastey’n pobble : as tra nagh dod Eh shickyrys y gheddyn kyndagh rish y voirrainys, doardee Eh Eh dy ve er ny chur stiagh ayns y chashtal.",

"36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.","Son roih yn slane chaglym jeh’n pobble geiyrt er, geamagh, Ersooyl lesh.",
"37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?","As myr va Paul dy gholl stiagh ayns y chashtal, dooyrt Eh rish yn ard chaptan, Voym kied loayrt rhyt? Dooyrt eshyn, Vod oo Greek y loayrt?",

"40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,","As tra v’eh er chur kied da, hass Paul er ny greeshyn, as chrie Eh e laue er y pobble : as tra huit ad feer fea-agh, loayr Eh roo ayns glare ny Hebrewyn, gra.",

"3 I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.","Ta mish dy firrinagh my ghooinney ta my Hew, ruggyr ayns Tarsus, ard-valley ayns Cilicia, agh va mee troggit ayns yn ard-valley shoh, ec cassyn Gamaliel, as ynsit lurg aght s’gyerey jeh leigh ny ayraghyn, as va graih jeean aym gys Jee, myr t’eauish ooilley jiu.",
"4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.","As ren mee tranlaase er y raad shoh gys y baase, kiangley as livrey gys pryssoonyn, chammah deiney as mraane.",
"5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem, for to be punished.","Myr ta’n ard-saggyrt hene gymmyrkey feanish lhiam, as ooilley yn chanstyr : vow hooar mee myrgeddin screeuyn gys ny braaraghyn, as hie mee gys Damascus, dy chur lhiam adsyn v’ayns shen, kainlt gys Jerusalem, dy ve er nyn gerraghey.",
"6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.","As haink eh gy kione, myr va mee er my yurnah, tra haink mee er-gerrey da Damascus mysh y vun-laa, dy hoilshean doaltattym veih niau soilshey mooar mygeayrt y moo’m.",

"12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there,","As haink hym fer dy row yiarragh ad Ananias rish, dooinney crauee cordail rish y leigh, echey va goo mie veih ooilley ny Hewnyn va vaghey ayns shen,",

"17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance ;","As haink eh gy kione, tra va mee er jeet reesht gys Jerusalem, dy jarroo choud as va mee ec padjer ayns y chiamble, dy huit mee my-nealloo ;",

"22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not fit that he should live.","As deaisht ad rish gys y fockle shoh, as eisht hrog ad seose nyn goraaghyn, as dooyrt ad, Ersooyl lesh leid yn er shoh jeh’n thalloo : son cha vel eh cooie Eh dy ve bio.",
"23 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air,","As myr v’ad gyllaghey, as ceau jeu nyn eaddagh, as cur joan ’syn aer,",
"24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.","Hug yn ard chaptan saarey Eh dy ve er ny chur stiagh ayns y chashtal, goardaghey Eh dy ve feayshtit liorish custey ; dy voddagh Eh fys y gheddyn cre’n-fa v’ad gyllaghey myr shen n’oi.",
"25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?","As myr v’ad dy chiangley Eh lesh yeeallyn, dooyrt Paul rish y captan-keead va ny hassoo liorish, Vel eh lowit diuish dy chustey dooinney ta bentyn rish y Raue, as nagh vel er ny gheyrey?",
"26 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest : for this man is a Roman.","Tra cheayll yn captan-keead shen, hie Eh as dinsh Eh eh da’n ard chaptan, gra, Cur tastey cre t’ow dy yannoo ; son ta’n dooinney shoh bentyn rish y Raue.",

"28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.","Dreggyr yn ard chaptan, Lesh sim mooar dy argid hooar mish yn seyrsnaght shen. As dooyrt Paul, Agh ruggyr mish seyr.",
"29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.","Eisht jimmee adsyn chelleeragh veih lhisagh v’er veaysht Eh, as ghow yn ard chaptan hene aggle tra va fys echey dy row Eh bentyn rish y Raue, as er-y-fa dy row Eh er chiangley Eh.",
"30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.","Laa ny vairagh, er-yn-oyr dy row Eh aignagh fys y ve echey, ayns shickyrys cre va ny Hewnyn dy choyrt ny lieh, deayshil Eh Eh veih e yeulaghyn, as hug Eh saarey ny ard-saggyrtyn as ooilley yn choonceïl oc dy heet kionfenish, as hug Eh lesh Paul sheese, as hoie Eh Eh kiongoyrt roo.",

"And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.","As yeeagh Paul dy gyere er y choonceïl as dooyrt Eh, Gheiney as vraaraghyn, Ta mee er hirveish Jee ayns dy chooilley chooinsheanse vie, gys y laa t’ayn jiu.",

"3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?","Eisht dooyrt Paul rish, Nee Jee uss y woalley, voal yiallit : son vel uss d[t]y hoie dy my vriwnys’s lurg y leigh, as cur saarey mee dy ve bwoailt noi yn leigh.",

"5 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest : for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.","Eisht dooyrt Paul, Cha row fys aym, vraaraghyn, dy nee yn ard-saggyrt v’eh : son te scruit, Cha loayr oo dy holk jeh fer-reïl dty phobble.",
"6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.","Agh tra dennee Paul dy row yn derrey ayrn jeu nyn Sadduceeyn, as yn ayrn elley nyn Phariseeyn, deïe Eh ayns y choonceïl, Gheiney as vraaraghyn, Ta mee my Pharisee, my Vac da Pharisee : son treishteil as irree seose-reesht ny merriu ta mee eït gys coontey.",
"7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees : and the multitude was divided.","As tra v’eh er ghra shoh, dirree streeu eddyr ny Phariseeyn as ny Sadduceeyn, as va’n chaglym noi ry hoi.",
"8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit : but the Pharisees confess both.","Son ta ny Sadduceeyn gra nagh vel irree-seose-reesht ayn, ny ainle ny spyrryd ; agh ta ny Phariseeyn goaill roo ny neesht.",
"9 And there arose a great cry : and the scribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.","As va argane mooar er ny ghoostey : as dirree ny scruderyn va er paart ny Phariseeyn, as streeu ad, gra, Cha vel shinyn er geddyn foill erbee ayns y dooinney shoh : agh my ta spyrryd ny ainle er loayrt rish, ny lig dooin caggey noi Jee.",
"10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.","As myr va’n streeu mooadaghey va’n ard chaptan agglagh dy raipagh ad Paul ayns peeshyn, as doardee Eh sidooryn dy gholl sheese, as dy ghoaill Eh er niart veih nyn mast’ oc, as dy chur lhieu Eh stiagh ayns y chashtal.",
"11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul : for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.","As yn oie er-giyn hass y Chiarn liorish, as dooyrt Eh, Bee dy yien mie, Phaul : son myr t’ow er n’ymmyrkey feanish jeem’s ayns Jerusalem, myr shen myrgeddin shegin dhyt feanish y ymmyrkey ec y Raue.",
"12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.","As tra va’n laa ayn, hiaggyl shiartance jeh ny Hewnyn cooidjagh, as chiangle ad ad hene fo mollaght, gra nagh nee-agh ad as nagh niu-agh ad derrey veagh ad er varroo Paul.",
13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.,As va ny smoo na da-eed jeu ayns y drogh-choyrlaghey shoh.,
"14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.","As haink ad gys ny ard-saggyrtyn as y chanstyr, as dooyrt ad, Ta shin er chiangley shin hene fo mollaght mooar, nagh nee mad veg derrey vees shin er varroo Paul.",
"15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him : and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.","Nish er-y-fa shen jean-jee shiuish as y choonceïl fys y chur gys yn ard chaptan, Eh dy chur lesh Eh hiu mairagh, myr dy beagh red ennagh eu dy gheddyn toiggal sodjeh jeh mychione echey : as bee mainyn aarloo, roish my jig Eh nyn vaar, dy varroo Eh.",
"16 And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.","As tra cheayll mac shayrey Phaul jeh ny croutyn oc, jimmee Eh roish, as hie Eh stiagh ayns y chashtal, as dinsh Eh ooilley da Paul.",
"17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him.","Eisht deïe Paul er annane jeh ny captanyn-keead huggey, as dooyrt Eh, Cur lhiat yn dooinney aeg shoh ys yn ard chaptan ; son ta red ennagh echey dy insh da.",
"18 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.","Myr shen ghow Eh Eh, as hug Eh lesh Eh gys yn ard chaptan, as dooyrt Eh, Deïe Paul yn pryssoonagh orrym huggey, as ghuee Eh orrym mee dy chur lhiam yn dooinney aeg shoh hoods, son dy vel red ennagh echey dy ghra rhyt.",
"19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?","Eisht ghow yn ard-chaptan Eh er y laue, as hie Eh mârish dy lhiattee gys boayl er-lheh, as dênee Eh jeh, Cre shen t’ayd dy insh dooys?",

"21 But do not thou yield unto them : for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him : and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.","Agh ny jean uss er y raa oc : son ta aarloo dy ghoaill Eh er-skyn da-eed dooinney jeu, t’er chiangley ad hene fo mollaght, nagh jean ad gee ny giu derrey vees ad er varroo Eh : as nish t’ad aarloo, jerkal rish gialdyn y gheddyn voids.",
"22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.","Myr shen lig yn ard chaptan yn raad da’n dooinney aeg, as hug Eh currym da, Jeeagh nagh ninsh oo da dooinney erbee dy vel oo er hoilshaghey ny reddyn shoh dooys.",

"9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.","As va ny Hewnyn er yn un ghlare rish, gra, dy nee shen myr va’n chooish.",
"10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :","Eisht dreggyr Paul, tra va’n kiannoort er chra e laue er dy loayrt, Son wheesh as dy vel fys aym dy vel uss er ve rish ymmodee dy vleeantyn dty vriw da’n ashoon shoh, ta mee ny s’aggindee dy ansoor er my hon hene ;",
"11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.","Er-y-fa dy vod oo toiggal y ghoaill, nagh vel agh daa laa yeig foast neayr as hie mee seose dy chur ooashley ec Jerusalem.",
"12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city :","As cha dooar ad mee ayns y chiamble resooney rish dooinney erbee, ny greinnaghey yn pobble gys irree-magh, edyr ayns ny kialteenyn, ny ayns yn ard-valley :",
13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.,"Cha-moo t’ad abyl ny reddyn t’ad dy choyrt my lieh y phrowal. ",
"14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :","Agh shoh ta mee goaill-rish dhyt, lurg yn aght t’adsyn genmys shaghrynys veih yn chredjue, dy nee shen myr ta mish cur ooashley da Jee my ayraghyn, credjal dagh nhee ta scruit ayns y leigh as ny phadeyryn :",
"15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.","As ta treishteil aym gys Jee, red t’ad hene myrgeddin dy lowal, dy bee irree-seose-reesht jeh ny merriu ayn, chammah jeh cairagh as neu-chairagh.",
"16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offence toward God, and toward men.","As er-yn-oyr shoh ta mee er my chliaghtey hene, cooinsheanse gyn loght y ve aym kinjagh gys Jee as gys deiney.",
"17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.","Nish lurg ymmodee dy vleeantyn, haink mee dy chur lhiam jeirk gys my ashoon hene, as ourallyn.",
"18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.","Er shoh hooar shiartance dy Hewnyn veih Asia mee er my ghlenney ayns y chiamble, agh cha nee lesh chymsaghey sleih, ny boirrainys :",
"19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.","As lhisagh ad ve ayns shoh dy loayrt m’oi, my va red erbee oc dy choyrt my lieh. ",
"20 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,","Er nonney lig daue shoh hene loayrt, my hooar ad mee-chairys erbee aynym, tra hass mee kiongoyrt y choonceïl ;",
"21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.","Mannagh vel mee son yn un choraa shoh hug mee magh tra hass mee nyn mast’ oc, Mychione irree-seose-reesht ny merriu ta mee eït gys coontey lieriu jiu.",
"22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.","Tra cheayll Felix shoh, hug Eh ad shiaghey, liorish dy row toiggal sodjey echey jeh’n raad shen, as dooyrt Eh, Tra hig Lysias yn ard chaptan neose, yoyms fys er bun y chooish eu.",
"23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.","As doardee Eh captan-keead dy yeeaghyn da Paul, as e remys y ve echey, as nagh lhiettagh Eh veg jeh’n ainjys echey dy hirveish dy hirveish, ny dy heet huggey.",
"24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.","As lurg shiartance dy laghyn, haink Felix as e ven Drusilla, va ny Hew, as hug Eh fys er Paul, as deaisht Eh rish mychione y credjue ayns Creest.",
"25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.","As myr v’eh loayrt mychione cairys, sheeltys, as y vriwnys va ry heet, chrie Felix, as dansoor Eh, Immee royd nish ; tra vees traa cooie aym, verrrym fys ort.",
"26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.","V’eh treishteil myrgeddin dy beagh Paul er chur argid da, son feaysley chur da ; shen-y-fa v’eh cur fys er ny s’menkey dy loayrt rish.",
"27 ¶But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room : and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."," Agh ec kione daa vlein, haink Porcius Festus ayns ynnyd Felix : as liorish dy row Felix booiagh ny Hewnyn y wooiys, daag Eh Paul ny phryssoonagh.",
,CAB. XXV.,
"Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.","Nish tra va Festus er jeet gys y cheer, ec kione three laa hie Eh seose veih Cesarea gys Jerusalem.",
"2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,","Eisht hug yn ard-saggyrt, as leedeilee ny Hewnyn coontey da jeh Paul, as ren ad aghin huggey,",
"3 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.","As ghuee ad er yn foayr shoh y yeeaghyn daue n’oi, Eh dy chur fys er gys Jerusalem, son dy row ad soit er e vioys y ghoaill er y raad. ",
"4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.","Agh dreggyr Festus, dy beagh Paul freilt ec Cesarea, as dy ragh Eh hene ayns shen dy gerrit.",
"5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.","Lig dauesyn er-y-fa shen ta er y hon nyn mast’ eu, dooyrt eshyn, goll sheese mâryms, as cur noi yn dooinney shoh foill erbee dy vel ayn.",
"6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.","As tra v’eh er vuirriaght nyn mast’ oc erskyn jeih laa, hie Eh sheese gys Cesarea ; as laa ny vairagh hoie Eh er stoyl y vriwnys, as hug Eh saarey Paul y chur ayns yn enish echey.",
"7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.","As tra v’eh er jeet, hass ny Hewnyn haink veih Jerusalem mygeayrt, as hug ad ymmodee foiljyn eajee dys lieh Phaul, nagh row ad abyl y yannoo mie ; ",
"8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.","Eshyn ayns y traa gra er e hon hene, Nagh row Eh noi leigh ny Hewnyn, ny noi yn chiamble, ny foast noi Cesar, er ve foiljagh ayns nhee erbee.",
"9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?","Agh dansoor Festus, liorish dy row Eh booiagh ny Hewnyn y wooiys, as dooyrt Eh rish Paul, Vel oo booiagh goll seose gys Jerusalem, ayns shen dy ve er dty vriwnys son ny reddyn shoh kiongoyrt rhym’s?",
"10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged : to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.","Eisht dooyrt Paul, Ta mee my hassoo ec stoyl-briwnys Cesar, raad te cooie dou dy ve briwnyssit : da ny Hewnyn cha vel mee er n’yannoo aggair erbee, myr t’ow toiggal dy feer vie.",
"11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.","Son my ta mee my ghrogh-yantagh, ny my ta mee er n’yannoo nhee erbee dy hoilchin baase, cha vel mee gobbal baase y hurranse : agh mannagh vel veg jeh ny reddyn shoh firrinagh t’ad shoh dy choyrt my lieh, cha vod dooinney erbee mish y livrey seose huc. Ta mee peallal gys Cesar. ",
"12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.","Eisht loayr Festus rish y choonceïl, as dooyrt Eh, Vel oo er pheallal gys Cesar? gys Cesar heu.",
13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.,"As ec kione shiartance dy laghyn, haink ree Agrippa as Bernice gys Cesarea dy yeeaghyn Festus.",
"14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix :","As erreish daue v’er ve ayns shen ymmodee dy laghyn, hoilshee Festus cooish Phaul da’n ree, gra, Ta dooinney ayns shoh va faagit ny phryssoonagh liorish Felix :",
"15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.","Mychione echey, tra va mee ec Jerusalem, ren ny ard-saggyrtyn as shanstyr ny Hewnyn aghin hym, geearree Eh dy ve briwnyssit.",
"16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.","Dansoor mish ad, Nagh nee cliaghtey yn vooinjer va bentyn rish y Raue ve dy livrey dooinney erbee seose gys baase, derrey veagh y fer veagh er ny chassid, as adsyn veagh dy chassid Eh noi ry hoi, as kied echey loayrt er e hon hene mychione yn oill veagh er ny choyrt ny lieh.",
"17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.","Shen-y-fa tra v’ad er jeet ayns shoh, fegooish lhiggey-shiaghey hoie mee laa ny vairagh er stoyl y vriwnys, as doardee mee yn dooinney y chur kionfenish.",
"18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed :","N’oi, tra va’n vooinjer va dy phlaiynt Eh er hassoo seose, cha dug ad nhee erbee dys e lieh jeh ny reddyn va mish dy smooinaghtyn :",
"19 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.","Agh va shiartance dy whestionyn oc n’oi, mychione y rouyr fardail v’ayns y chraueeaght oc, as mychione fer va enmyssit Yeesey va marroo, agh hickyree Paul dy row Eh bio.",
"20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.","Er-yn-oyr dy row mee ayns imnea mychione leid ny questionyn, dênee mee jeh row Eh booiagh goll seose gys Jerusalem, ayns shen dy ve briwnyssit son ny reddyn shoh.",
"21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.","Agh tra va Paul er pheallal dy ve freilt gys clashtyn Augustus, hug mee saarey Eh dy v’er ny reaylley derrey oddin Eh y choyrt gys Cesar.",
"22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.","Eisht dooyrt Agrippa rish Festus, v’ein’s mee hene booiagh yn dooinney y chlashtyn. Mairagh, dooyrt eshyn, nee oo clashtyn Eh.",
"23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.","As laa ny vairagh, tra va Agrippa er jeet, as Bernice ayns stayd vooar, as er gholl stiagh ayns thie ny quaylagh, marish ny ard chaptanyn, as ard deiney yn ard-valley, ec saarey Festus va Paul er ny choyrt kionfenish.",
"24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.","As dooyrt Festus, Ree Agrippa, as dy chooilley ghooinney t’ayns shoh kionfenish mârin, hee shiu yn dooinney shoh, mychione ta ooilley ny Hewnyn er phlaynt hyms, chammah ec Jerusalem as ayns shoh, geamagh nagh lhisagh Eh ve ny sodjey bio.",
"25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.","Agh tra hooar mish magh nagh row Eh er n’yannoo nhee erbee dy hoilchin baase, as dy row Eh hene er pheallal gys Augustus, ta mee kiarit dy choyrt Eh.",
"26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.","As er-y-fa nagh vel shickyrys aym jeh nhee erbee oddym y scrieu gys my hiarn, ta mee er choyrt lhiam Eh magh kiongoyrt riu, agh er-skyn ooilley kiongoyrt rhyts, Ree Agrippa, erreish da ve feayshtit, dy vod red ennagh ve aym dy scrieu.",
"27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.","Son va mee smooinaghtyn dy row eh red neu-resoonagh pryssoonagh y choyrt, as gyn ny foiljyn v’er ny chur gys e lieh y hoilshaghey. ",
,CAB. XXVI.,
"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself :","Eisht dooyrt Agrippa rish Paul, Ta kied ayd loayrt er dty hon hene. Eisht heeyn Paul magh e laue, as dansoor Eh er e hon hene,",
"2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews :","Ta mee jeeaghyn er myr bannaght, Ree Agrippa, er-y-fa dy vel mee dy ansoor er my hon hene jiu kiongoyrt rhyts, mychione ooilley ny reddyn ta ny Hewnyn dy chur my lieh :",
3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.,"Er-skyn ooilley, er-y-fa dy vel toiggal ayd jeh dy chooilley chliaghtey as question ta mastey ny Hewnyn : shen-y-fa ta mee guee ort, oo dy eaishtagh rhym dy surransagh.",
"4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews ;","My ymmyrkey-bea veih my aegid, va hoshiaght mastey my ashoon hene ec Jerusalem, ta fys ec ooilley ny Hewnyn er,",
"5 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.","Va enney oc orrym er dyn toshiaght, (dy jinnagh ad feanish y ymmyrkey) kys lurg yn aght s’gyerey jeh’n chredjue ain, ren mee baeghey my Pharisee.",
"6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, unto our fathers :","As nish ta mee my hassoo, as er my vriwnys son treishteil y gialdyn ren Jee da ny ayraghyn ain :",
"7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.","Gys y gialdyn cheddin ta’n daa heeloghe yeig ain, ta shirveish Jee oie as laa, treishteil dy heet, as er coontey yn treishteil shoh, Ree Agrippa, ta mee er my chassid liorish ny Hewnyn.",
"8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?","Cre’n-fa te smooinit lieriuish red nagh vel dy ve creddit, Jee dy vioghey ny merriu?",
"9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.",Ghow mish dy jarroo aym pene dy lhisin ymmodee dy reddyn y yannoo noi ennym Yeesey dy Nazareth.,
"10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.","As shen ren mee neesht ayns Jerusalem : as ymmodee jeh ny nooghyn yeigh mee ayns pryssoon, erreish dou v’er gheddyn pooar veih ny ard-saggyrtyn ; as tra v’ad er nyn goyrt gy baase, hug mee my choraa nyn oi oc.",
"11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.","As cherree mee ad dy mennick ayns dy chooilley cheeill, as deaginee mee ad dy loayrt goan-mollaghtagh ; as va mee ass towse elgyssagh nyn oi oc, as ren mee tranlaase orroo gys eer ard-valjyn joarree.",
"12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,",Er shoh tra hie mee gys Damascus lesh pooar as barrantys veih ny ard-saggyrtyn ;,
"13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.","Ec mun-laa, O ree, honnick mee er y raad soilshey veih niau erskyn sollyssit y ghrian, soilshean mygeayrt y moo’ms, as y vooinjer v’er nyn yurnah mârym.",
"14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.","As tra va shin ooilley er duittym gys y thalloo, cheayll mee coraa loayrt rhym, as gra ayns glare ny Hebrewyn, Saul, Saul, cre’n-fa t’ow jannoo tranlaase orrym?

"15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.","As dooyrt mish, Quoi oo, Hiarn? As dooyrt Eh, Mish Yeesey t’ow jannoo tranlaase er.",
"16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;","Agh irree, as shass er dty chassyn : son ta mish er hoilshaghey mee hene dhyt er yn oyr shoh, dy yannoo oo d[t]y hirveishagh as d[t]y eanish, chammah jeh ny reddyn t’ow er vakin, as jeh ny reddyn ayndoo nee’m mee hene y hoilshaghey dhyt ;",
"17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,","Fendeil oo veih yn pobble, as vowsyn jeh ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, huc ta mee nish dy dty choyrt.",
"18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.","Dy osley nyn sooyllyn, as dy hyndaa ad veih dorraghys gys soilshey, as veih pooar Noid-ny-hanmey gys Jee, dy vod ad leih peccaghyn y gheddyn, as eiraght nyn mast’ ocsyn t’er nyn gasherickey liorish y credjue ta aynyms.",
"19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision :","Er shoh, Ree Agrippa, cha row mee mee-viallagh gys yn ashlish flaunyssagh :",
"20 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.","Agh hoilshee mee hoshiaght dauesyn v’ayns Damascus, as ec Jerusalem, as trooid ooilley cheer Yudea, as eisht da ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, ad dy ghoaill arrys as dy hyndaa gys Jee, as obbraghyn y yannoo cooie son arrys.",
"21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.","Son ny oyryn shoh haare ny Hewnyn mee ayns y chiamble, as ghow ad ayns laue my varroo.",
"22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come :","Lesh y cooney er-y-fa shen hooar mee veih Jee, ta mee er-mayrn gys y laa t’ayn jiu, gymmyrkey feanish chammah gys beg as mooar, fegooish nhee erbee sodjey y ghra na dooyrt ny phadeyryn as Moses harragh gy kione :",
"23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.","Dy row Creest dy hurranse, as dy nee Eh veagh y chied er irragh veih ny merriu, as dy jinnagh Eh soilshey y hoilshaghey da’n pobble, as gys ny Ashoonyn-quaagh.",
"24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad.","As myr v’eh myr shoh loayrt er e hon hene, dooyrt Festus lesh ard choraa, T’ow ass dty cheeal, Phaul : ta’n ynsagh mooar dy chur oo er-shaghryn.",

"26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely : for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner.","Son ta fys ec y ree er ny reddyn shoh, kiongoyrt rish er-y-fa shen ta mee loayrt dy arryltagh : son ta mee credjal nagh vel veg jeh ny reddyn shoh kellit veih ; son cha row shoh jeant ayns corneil.",
"27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.","Ree Agrippa, vel oo credjal ny phadeyryn? ta fys aym dy vel oo credjal. ",
"28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.","Eisht dooyrt Agrippa rish Paul, T’ow faggys er my hayrn dy ve my Chreestee.",
"29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.","As dooyrt Paul, Yee dy beagh, cha nee ynrycan uss, agh myrgeddin ooilley ny ta dy my chlashtyn jiu, chammah faggys as ooilley cooidjagh leid as ta mish, cheu-mooie jeh ny geulaghyn shoh.",
"30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them :","As tra v’eh er ghra shoh, dirree yn ree, as y kiannoort, as Bernice, as adsyn va nyn soie mâroo ;",
"31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.","As hie ad dy lhiattee, as loayr ad eddyr ad hene, gra, Cha vel y dooinney shoh jannoo nhee erbee ta toilchin baase ny bondiaght.",
"32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.","Eisht dooyrt Agrippa rish Festus, Oddagh feaysley ve ec y dooinney shoh, erbey dy ren Eh peallal gys Cesar. ",
,CAB. XXVII.,
"And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of Augustus’ band.","As tra ve kiarit dy row shin dy ghoaill luingys gys Italy, livrey ad Paul as shiartance dy phryssoonee elley, gys fer va enmyssit Julius captan-keead v’ayns sheshaght Augustus.",
"2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.","As hie shin ayns lhong veih Adramyttium, hie shin magh son y cheayin, kiarrail shiauley shiaghey coastyn Asia, as va Aristarchus, Macedonian veih Thessalonica mârin.",
"3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.","As yn nah laa haink shin gys Sidon : as ghell Julius dy dooie rish Paul, cur kied da goll mastey e gheiney mooinjerey dy voddagh kiarrail ve goit jeh.

"4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.","As tra va shin er gholl magh veih shen, hiauil shin fo Cyprus, er-y-fa dy row yn gheay nyn oi.",
"5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.","As tra va shin er hiauley harrish keayn Cilicia as Pamphylia, haink shin gys Myra ard-valley ayns Lycia.",
6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy ; and he put us therein.,As ayns shen hooar y captain-keead lhong ass Alexandria v’er y veyge eck gys Italy ; as hug Eh shin er-board.,
"7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone ;","As tra va shin er hiauley dy moal ymmodee dy laghyn, as dy goan va shin er jeet jeeragh er Cnidus, son nagh row yn gheay lhien, hiauil shin fo Crete, magh veih Salmone :",

"9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,","Nish tra va mooarane traa baarit, as dy row shiauley nish dangeragh, er-yn-oyr dy row earish yn trostey nish er gholl shiaghey, choyrlee Paul ad,",
"10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.","As dooyrt Eh roo, Gheiney mie, ta mee cur tastey dy bee yn veyge shoh lesh skielley as coayl mooar, cha nee ynrycan jeh’n lught as y lhong, agh myrgeddin gys nyn mioys.",
"11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.","Ny-yeih chred yn captan-keead mainshtyr as pilot ny luingey, ny smoo na ny reddyn va Paul dy loayrt.",
"12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter ; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.","As er-y-fa nagh row eh purt mie dy ve ayn car y yeuree, choyrlee yn ayrn smoo jeh’n cheshaght ad dy gholl rowe veih shen, my oddagh ad er aght erbee cosney gys Phenice, dy voddagh ad yn geurey y chur shiaghey ayns shen ; she purt t’ayns Crete eh, as te lhie gys yn neear-ass as yn neear-hwoai. ",
"13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.","As er-y-fa dy row geay-jass as cuiney ayn, heill ad dy beagh nyn earree oc, as deayshil ad veih shen, as hiauil ad close shiaghey Crete. ",
"14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.","Agh my daink ny voddey dirree geay sterrymagh nyn oi oc, va enmyssit Yn gheay niar-hwoai.",
"15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.","As tra nagh rowe yn lhong cosney, as nagh dod ee cummal seose gys y gheay, lhig shin jee tuittym lesh.",
"16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat :","As roih shin fo ellan dy row, ta enmyssit Clauda, as va lane obbyr ain dy ghoaill stiagh yn baatey :",
"17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship ; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.","Agh tra v’ee goit seose oc, ren ad ymmyd jeh saasyn, hoïll ad y lhong fo lesh cablyn ; as er aggle dy duittagh ad ayns geinnagh vio, ghow ad yn shiaul neose, as myr shen lhig ad y raad jee. ",
"18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship ;","As erreish dooin ve eiyrit er-skyn towse noon as noal lesh y doyrrin, yn nah laa deddrymmee ad y lhong :",
19 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.,As yn tress laa hug shin magh lesh nyn laueyn hene greie ny luingey.,
"20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.","As tra nagh daink grian ny aist rish ayns ymmodee dy laghyn, as dy row shin fo sterrym nagh nee beggan, cha row shin ny sodjey jerkal rish dy v’er nyn sauail.",
"21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.","As erreish daue v’er ve foddey nyn drostey, hass Paul magh nyn mast’ oc, as dooyrt Eh, Lhisagh shiu, gheiney mie, v’er n’eaishtagh rhyms, as gyn v’er veaysley veih Crete, dy gheddyn yn skielley as y coayl shoh.",
"22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you, but of the ship.","As nish ta mee coyrlaghey shiu dy ve ayns gien mie, son cha bee coayl jeh bioys dooinney erbee nyn mast’ eu, agh jeh’n lhong.",
"23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,","Son hass lioryms noght ainle Yee, quoi slesh mee, as Eh ta mee dy hirveish,",
"24 Saying, Fear not, Paul ; thou must be brought before Caesar : and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.","Gra, Ny gow aggle, Phaul ; shegin dhyt shassoo kiongoyrt rish Cesar : as cur-my ner, ta Jee er chur dhyt ooilley adsyn ta shiauley mârt.",
"25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer : for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.","Shen-y-fa, Gheiney mie, cum-jee seose nyn gree : son ta mee credjal Jee, dy bee eh myr te inshit dou.",
26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.,Ny yeih shegin dooin ve ceaut stiagh er ellan.,
"27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;","Agh tra va’n chiarroo oie yeig er jeet, myr va shin eiyrit noon as noal ayns keayn Adria, mysh y vain-oie heill ny marreeyn dy row ad tayrn er-gerrey da cheer ennagh :",
"28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.","As cheau ad magh yn leoaie, as dennee ad dy row feed feiy oc : as tra v’ad er gholl red beg sodjey, hug ad magh yn leoaie reesht, as hooar ad eh queig feiyn jeig.",
"29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.","Eisht er aggle dy roiagh ad er creggyn, hilg ad kiare akeryn magh ec y stiurey, as ghow ad foddiaght son y laa.",
"30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,","As myr va ny marreeyn mysh cosney ass y lhong, tra v’ad er lhiggey yn baatey sheese er y cheayn, myr dy beagh ad goll dy hilgey akeryn magh ec toshiaght ny luingey,",
"31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.","Dooyrt Paul rish y captan-keead as rish ny sidooryn, Mannagh vuirree ad shoh ayns y lhong, cha vod shiu v’er nyn sauail.",
"32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.","Eish[t] yiare ny sidooryn teddyn y vaatey, as lhig ad y raad jee.",
"33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.","As myr va’n laa soilshaghey, choyrlee Paul ad ooilley dy ghoaill beaghey, gra, Ta shiu jiu er chur shiaghey yn chiarroo laa yeig, as er chummal nyn drostey, fegooish nhee erbee y ghoaill.",
34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.,Shen-y-fa my choyrle’s eh shiu dy ghoaill beaghey ; son te son y slaynt eu : son cha duit renaig jeh kione annane eu.,
"35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it, he began to eat.","As tra v’eh er ghra shoh, ghow Eh arran, as hug eh booise da Jee, ayns yn enish oc ooilley, as vrish Eh eh, as ren Eh toshiaght dy ee.",
"36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.","Eisht v’ad ooilley ayns cree mie, as myrgeddin ghow ad beaghey.",
37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.,"As va shin ayns ooilley ayns y lhong, daa cheead, three feed as shey anmeenyn jeig.",
"38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.","As tra v’ad er n’ee dy liooar, deddrymmee ad y lhong, as hilg ad y churnaght magh ayns y cheayn.",
"39 And when it was day, they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.","As tra va’n laa ayn, cha dug ad enney er y thalloo : agh chronnee ad giuag dy row, as er y traie echey, v’ad aignagh, my ve possible, yn lhong y roie stiagh.",
"40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.","As hrog ad ny akeryn, as daag ad ad hene gys y cheayn, as deayshil ad bondaghyn y stiurey, as hug ad yn shiaul main gys y gheay, as ren ad gys y traie.",
"41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.","As huit ad ayns boayl raad va daa fairkey cheet quail y chielley, as roih ad y lhong er thalloo ; as va’n toshiaght eck soit cha shickyr, nagh row ee scughey, agh va’n jerrey eck brisht lesh niart ny tonnyn.",
"42 And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.","As coyrle ny sidooryn ve dy varroo ny pryssoonee, er aggle dy snaauagh veg jeu magh, as dy gosnagh ad rowe.",
"43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land :","Agh va’n captan-keead booiagh Paul y hauail, as lhiett Eh ad veih shen y yannoo, as doardee Eh adsyn oddagh snaaue, ad dy hilgey ad hene hoshiaght ayns y cheayn, as ad dy hayrtyn gys y thalloo :",
"44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.","As y chooid elley, paart er buird, as paart er peeshyn jeh’n lhong : as myr shen haink eh gy kione, dy dooar ad ooilley dy sauchey gys thalloo.",
,CAB. XXVIII.,
"And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.","As erreish daue v’er geddyn dy sauchey er thalloo, eisht va fys oc dy row yn ellan enmyssit Melita.",
"2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.","As va ny barbarianee feer dooie dooin ; son dod ad aile, as ghow ad dy chooilley annane ain stiagh kyndagh rish y fliaghey v’ayn, as kyndagh rish y feayraght.",
"3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.","As heih Paul kionnan dy vrasnagyn, as hug Eh ad er yn aile, as haink ard-nieu as y chiass, as leïme eh er e laue.",
"4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.","As tra honnick ny barbarianee yn cretoor pooshoonagh croghey rish e laue, dooyrt ad nyn mast’ oc hene, Fegooish dooyt ta’n dooinney shoh ny ghunver, cha lhig kerraghey Yee da ve bio, ga t’eh er scapail y keayn.",
"5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.","As chrie Eh yn ard-nieu jeh’n laue echey ayns yn aile, as cha dennee Eh skielley erbee.",
"6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly : but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.","Agh ghow adsyn oc hene dy beagh Eh er n’att, ny er duittym sheese marroo doaltattym ; agh tra v’ad foddey er n’yeeaghyn, as nagh vaik ad aggair erbee er jeet er, haink ad gys smooinaghtyn elley, as dooyrt ad dy nee Jee v’eh.",
"7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius ; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.","Ayns ny ardjyn shen va thieyn as thalloo lesh kiannoort ny hellan, va enmyssit Publius, veih hooar shin oltaghey-bea, as aaght ry three laa dy gennal.",
"8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.","As haink eh gy kione, dy row ayr Publius ny lhie dy ching ayns y chiassaghey, as ayns giarey folley : as hie Paul stiagh huggey, as ghow Eh padjer, as hug Eh e laueyn er, as laanee Eh Eh.",
"9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed :","As erreish da v’er n’yannoo shoh, haink feallagh elley neesht va doghanyn oc ayns yn ellan, as v’ad er nyn lheihys :",
"10 Who also honoured us with many honours ; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.","As hug ad ymmodee leaghyn onnoroïl dooin, as tra va shin goll roïn, laad ad shin lesh leid ny reddyn as veagh ymmyrchagh. ",
"11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.","As lurg three meeghyn, hiauil shin ayns lhong dy Alexandria v’er ve car y yeuree ayns yn ellan, yn cowrey eck va Castor as Pollux.",
"12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.","As haink shin er thalloo ec Syracuse, duirree shin ayns shen three laa.",
"13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium : and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli :","As veih shen hiauil shin mygeayrt, as haink shin gys Rhegium : as ec kione un laa heid y gheay ec y jass ; as yn nah laa haink shin gys Puteoli :",
"14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days : and so we went toward Rome.","Ayns shen hooar shin braaraghyn, as va aghin jeant hooin shin dy uirriaght mâroo shiaght laa : as shen myr hie shin gys y Raue.",
"15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns : whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.","As veih shen, tra cheayll ny braaraghyn jin, haink ad magh nyn guail choud as Appii forum, as choud as ny Three ard-thieyn oast : as tra honnick Paul ad, hug Eh booise da Jee, as ghow Eh dunnalys.",
"16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.","As tra haink shin gys y Raue, livrey yn captan-keead ny pryssoonee gys captan y ghard : agh ve lowit da Paul thie y ve echey da hene, marish sidoor va dy yeeaghyn da. ",
"17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together : and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.","As haink eh gy kione lurg three laa, dy deïe Paul er ny ard Hewnyn cooidjagh. As tra v’ad er jeet huggey, dooyrt Eh roo, Gheiney as vraaraghyn, ga nagh vel mee er n’yannoo nhee erbee noi yn pobble, ny cliaghtaghyn ny ayraghyn ain, foast va mee er my livrey seose my phryssoonagh veih Jerusalem gys laueyn y vooinjer ta bentyn rish y Raue.",
"18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.","As tra v’ad shoh er my eaysht, v’ad booiagh yn raad y lhiggey dou, er-y-fa nagh row oyr erbee baaish aynym.",
"19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar ; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.","Agh tra loayr ny Hewnyn m’oi, va mee eaginit dy pheallal gys Cesar ; cha nee son dy row playnt erbee aym dy yannoo er my ashoon.",
"20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.","Er-yn-oyr shoh er-y-fa shen ta mee er chur fys erriuish, dy akin shiu, as dy loayrt riu : er-y-fa son treishteil Israel dy vel mee kainlt lesh y geuley shoh.",
"21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.","As dooyrt ad rish, Cha dooar shinyn screeuyn veih Judea my dty chione, cha-moo ren veg jeh ny braaraghyn t’er jeet soilshaghey ny loayrt red erbee dy holk jeed.",
"22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest : for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.","Agh ta shin booiagh clashtyn voids, cre t’ow dy smooinaghtyn : son mychione y shaghrynys shoh veih’n chredjue, ta fys ain dy vel eh ayns dy chooilley ynnyd loayrit noi.",
"23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging ; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.","As tra v’ad er hoiaghey laa da, haink ymmodee huggey gys e hie ; as hug Eh tushtey daue, as dymmyrk Eh feanish jeh reeriaght Yee, coyrlaghey ad mychione Yeesey, chammah ass leigh Voses, as veih ny phadeyryn, veih moghrey derrey fastyr.",
"24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.","As va paart jeu chred ny reddyn va loayrit, as paart elley nagh ren credjal.",
"25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,","As tra nagh chord ad nyn mast’ oc hene, jimmee ad rowe, erreish da Paul v’er loayrt un ockle, S’mie loayr yn Spyrryd Noo liorish Esaias yn phadeyr rish ny ayraghyn ain.",
"26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive :","Gra, Gow royd gys y pobble shoh as abbyr, Liorish clashtyn, nee shiu clashtyn, agh cha doig shiu : as lesh fakin, nee shiu fakin, agh cha gronnee shiu.",
"27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.","Son ta cree yn phobble shoh er n’aase roauyr, as ta ny cleashyn oc moal dy chlashtyn, as nyn sooyllyn  t’ad er n’yeigh ; er aggle dy jinnagh ad fakin lesh nyn sooyllyn, as clashtyn lesh nyn gleashyn, as toiggal lesh nyn greeaghyn, as dy beagh ad er nyn jyndaa, as dy jinnin ad y lheihys.",
"28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.","Lig da fys y ve eauish er-y-fa shen, dy vel saualtys Yee er ny choyrt gys ny Ashoonyn-quaagh, as dy neaisht ad rish.",
"29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.","As tra v’eh er loayrt ny goan shoh, jimmee ny Hewnyn rowe, as va mooarane resooney nyn mast’ oc hene.",
"30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,","As chum Paul ry daa vlein cooidjagh ayns e hie maallee hene, goaill stiagh dy chooilley annane va cheet huggey ;",
"31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.","Preacheil daue reeriaght Yee, as gynsaghey ny reddyn va bentyn rish y Chiarn Yeesey Creest, lesh dunnalys, as fegooish ve er ny lhiettal.",
