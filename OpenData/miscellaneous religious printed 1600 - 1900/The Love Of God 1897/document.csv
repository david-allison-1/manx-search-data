"The service at which this sermon was preached was refered by the '‘Daily Mail” (London's the “Western Mail” and a large number of other English and Welsh newspapers as being one of. the most remarkable ever held in. the Isle of Man. Some American papers also gave an account of it; and the preacher received several requests for a copy of the sermon which he delivered there. He publishes this brief summary of what he said, praying that it may be a means of blessing.",,1,,
"Also, at this service, Mr H. T. Evans, editor of “The Journal,” Carmarthen, spoke in Welsh and Cornish, and a Captain of a Norwegian barque repeated the Lord’s Prayer in the Norwegian tongue.",,1,,

"The First Epistle General of John, 4th chapter, Sth verse ; “ GOD IS LOVE.”","Yn chied Screeunyn veih Ean. Gys ny Chresteenyn ooilley, cab. 4,v. 8: “TA JEE GRAIH.”",2,6,
The Heavens bear witness to this truth. It is engraved on all the works of God. Who doubts his love ? No one can. Even devils “ believe and tremble.”,Ta ny niaughyn gynimyrkey feanish gys yn firrinys shoh. Te er ny grainney er ooilley obbraghyn Yee. Quoi ta dooyteil e graih. Cha vel unnane erbee. Ta ny drogh-spyrrydyn hene credjal as er creau.,2,6,
I. Let us in the first place notice the nature of His love.,"[I] Lhig dooin ayns yn chied boayl, chur tastey dy dhooghys e graih.",2,6,
"1. That this love is undeserved. He loved us when we were in our sins, under His wrath, lost, totally depraved. He revealed to those who first disobeyed His commandment, that “The Seed of the woman should bruise the head of the serpent.” “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation (or satisfaction) for our sins.","1. Cha ren shin toilliu, lheid yn graih. Hug eh graih dooin, tra va shinyn ayns nyn beccaghyn, fo jymmoose, caillit, neughlen ayns chree.

Ayns shoh ta graih, cha nee dy dug shin graih da JEE, agh dy dug eshyn graih dooin, as dy ren eh e Vac, y choyrt dy ve lhiassaghey son nyn beccaghyn.",2,6,
"2. The extent of His love. It embraces the whole world. “ For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Who can measure His love ? It is a mountain, the top of which we can never reach; an ocean without bounds; a sea without a shore. The breadth and length and depth and height passeth all understanding. The greatness of His love is revealed in suffering for us, See the blood that flowed from the Saviour’s side. ","2. Yn Mooadys e graih. Te roshtyn yn slane seihll, “Son lheid y graih shen hug Jee da’n tbeili dj’ dug e ynrycan Vac v’er ny geddyn, nagh jinnagh quoi-erbee chredjagh aynsyn cherraghtyn, agh yn vea ta dy bragh farraghtyn y chosney.” Quoi oddys towse e graih.

Ta mooadys e graih er ny hoilshaghey ayns surranse er nyn son. Jeeagh er yn uill roie veih e Ihiattee.",2,6,
"Was there ever sympathy like that which Christ had, for he knew that he was coining to suffer death. How wonderful His love!","Row chymmey rieau myr chymmey Chreest, Son s’mie va echey fys, Dy row eh cheet dy hurranse baase. Nagh mooar va ghiastallys.",2,6,"Manx was on separate lines:
Row chymmey rieau myr chymmey Chreest,
Son s’mie va echey fys
Dy row eh cheet dy hurranse baase.
Nagh mooar va ghiastallys."
"3. His love is patient. Why does He bear over and over again with the wicked who slight His love ? Because He is a patient God, and of great longsuffering. He has no delight in the death of a sinner. “As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.” His justice and His mercy are on the side of those who turn from their sins. If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” He cometh to take vengeance on all those who will not repent and forsake their sins. He did so upon the inhabitants of the old world, and on Sodom. “ Behold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom : pride, fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and the needy.” (Ezekiel xvi. 49.) “'Even as Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them . . . are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.” (Jude 7.) Now then, “ How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation ?”“ Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish.”","3. Meenid eh graih.

4. God’s love is true love. It is according to His law ; it is in agreement with all His attributes. A God all mercy would be a God unjust. He is bound to make good His threatenings as well as His promises. The whole Trinity is at work for the salvation of the soul. The consistency of His love is seen in his righteous separation at last of the just and the unjust. He saves all those who repent and believe the Gospel.,"4. Ta graih JEE graih firrinagh.

II.. In the second place we will consider the operations of His love UPON THE HEART AND LIFE.,II. Lhig dooin ayns yn nah voayl smooinaghtyn er obbyr eh graih ayns yn chree as ayns yn bea.,3,6,
"1. It is beautiful in its working. The heart in its natural state, is deceitful above all things. Who can know it? The prophet Isaiah says : “But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.” Like the needle in the mariner’s compass cannot rest until it points due north, neither can the heart of man rest until it returns to God, the centre of its happiness. The human countenance is often an index or the soul. When the penitent turns from his sins seeking mercy, we have seen sorrow marked upon the lace by the rolling tears, as soon as he believes with the heart upon the Lord Jesus Christ The love of God is then shed (spilt) abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto him. The change of heart breaks forth on the countenance, the Love of God warms the heart inwardly. Filled with love! Glory to God!","1. Ta eh graih aalin ayns e obbyr.

"2. His love bestows upon us great honour. The men of the world consider it to be great honour to be Governor, a member of the House of Keys, a Deemster, or Justice of the Peace. But it is a greater honour to be a child of God. Herein is true nobility to be like God, partaking of His Divine nature — just, merciful, pure. The greatest honour is that which cometh from God : To be kings and prie-ts unto God and His Father for ever. Earthty distinctions are lost sight off at the glory which surrounds the Christian. Child of God rejoice, there lies before you the heavenly inheritance incorruptable, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. “ To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me on My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.” What an honour to be thus associated with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the arictocracy of heaven.","2.

"3. His love is comforting in trouble. There is no state in this life that will exempt us from trouble, man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward. Every character we bear, every office we fill, every relationship we sustain, is a fruitful source of trouble.. Everything around us says “ Hapiness is not in me.” Where does the men of the world go for comfort in the day of trouble ? Many go to the public-house and drink fiery waters to drown their sorrow, but bring upon themselves greater sadness.","3. Ta e graih gherjaghey ayns seaghyn.

"True happiness is not to be found in the pleasures of sin. Others retire from business to be free from trouble. But happiness cannot be found there. All alike feel their need of something to sweeten life. It is comforting in trouble to think that there is one who loves us. Thank God there is no trouble that heaven cannot heal. Where does the Christian go for comfort in times of sorrow ? God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. The love of God in the heart is powerful. Who can seperate us from such love ? The Apostle Paul says : “ Shall tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors, through Him that loved us. For I am persuaded, or I have the full assurance that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”","Cha vel gerjagh firrinagh dy geddyn ayns eunys peccah.

"4. His love is true riches. The happiness of man does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses. The soul cannot be satisfied with riches, though his lot may be cast in a pleasant land, for riches make to themselves wingsand fly away. Riches are taken away from them, or they are taken away from the riches. Oh! the deceitfulness of riches. What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul. Gold cannot purchase pardon for sin. What would Queen Elizabeth have given upon her death-bed for an hour of time ? She would have given all her riches “ Doctor! doctor! must I die,” she said, “Can you save me ? must I, must I die?” Even thus it is appointed. God's love is the greatest treasure when leaving the world. “Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? ” The love of God in the soul is the earnest of the riches of heaven--which are everlasting riches—a sure inheritance—many mansions—a throne-a city, the streets thereof are of pure gold. The gold is in the right place in heaven—under the feet of the saints. And they want it nowhere else. Men may die possessing thousands and thousands here, without the love of God in the heart. Better far to die, like one of old at the rich man’s gate, a beggar covered with sores. As soon as the soul left the body the angels carried him to Abraham’s bosom to be rich for evermore.","4.

"5. His love is enduring. All things around us are subject to change. The fondest ties may be severed. Lather, mother, sister, brother, are dear names. But from these we must part here. God’s love knows no change. It comforts in sorrow, temptation, death, and to all eternity. Have you tasted of His love in your heart ? To taste the love ot God is a reality. Do you know your sins forgiven ? Then you’ll feel the love of God filling your heart. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost will come in and flood your heart with love. God commendeth his love towards us. Accept as you are the gift of His love, and it will be heaven on the way to heaven. If you neglect accepting it, punishment is certain. The soul that sinnneth it shall die the death that never dies even the hell of fire. Turn ye! turn ye! for why will ye die ?","5. Ta eh graih tannaghtyn.
