"I set before you, as a token of my good will, a parish church; — a place, which should be dear both to the Minister and to the people; where we assemble together for the sacred work of prayer and thanksgiving; where God is somehow present; and where every one who worships devoutly finds himself in the HOUSE OF GOD and at the GATE OF HEAVEN.","TA mee soiaghey kiongoyrt riu, myr cowrey jeh my aigney mie, shilley jeh keeill skeerey;—ynnyd, lhisagh ve deyr chammah da’n Chirveishagh as da 'n pobble; raad to shin chaglym cooidjagh son yn obbyr casherick dy phadjer as dy hoyrt-booise; raad ta Jee ayns aght-er-lheh kionfenish; as raad ta dy chooilley unnane ta cur ooashley crauee feddyn eh hene ayns THIE Yee as ec Giat Niau.",1
"It is not my intention to set before you a vision of a church, as much as it pleases your eyes, or that it may always remind us of our spiritual blessings and our duty on the Lord's day. I would like every inhabitant of this county, when he looks at it, to say,  —","Cha vel my chiarail ayns soiaghey kiongoyrt riu shilley jeh keeill, wheesh dy wooiys ny sooillyn eu, as dy vod eh dy kinjagh coyrt shin ayns cooinaghtyn jeh nyn mannaghtyn spyrrydoil as nyn gurrym er laa yn Chiarn.

"To that holy house let me go with ready feet morning and evening every Sabbath. There must the remembrance of my fault beset me to go; To that must the hope of my mercy lead; In that God the Father is waiting to be gracious; In it God the Son sheds forth His blood which makes atonement for the sins of the world ; and God the Holy Ghost sheweth forth his sanctifying grace. With so much sin to confess, with all mercy to be grateful for, with such darkness in my mind, and such gloom in my heart, how can I delay from the house of the Lord on the day of the Lord? There is a Saviour crucified offering wisdom to the ignorant, strength to the weak, comfort to the brokenhearte, forgiveness of sins to the repentant, and salvation to the lost.”","Gys y thie casherick shen lhig dou goll lesh cassyn arryltagh er moghrey as fastyr dy chooilley ghoonaght.

"How shall I answer it to my conscience, how shall I conduct myself at the last day; if I am going to leave this holy place, and lose these spiritual blessings, that I may settle my accounts, go to see my friends, or wander about in pursuit of worldly pleasures! What is the account of such shame, and the state of my soul that shall never die? What is the work of such sorrow and seeking peace with God? What joy should be so pleasant, and sing praises to Him, who bought me with His blood?","Cre ’n aght oddym’s gansoor eh da my chooinsheanse, cre 'n aght oddym’s my ymmyrkey y heyrey ec y laa jerrinagh; my ta mee gobbal dy haaghey yn ynnyd casherick shoh, as ceau ersooyl ny bannaghtyn spyrrydoil shoh, dy voddym jannoo seose my choontaghyn, goll dy yeeaghyn my ainjyssee, ny rouail mygeayrt geiyrt er cooishyn ny eunyssyn seihlltagh!

"Shall I stay at home to do some thing which was left undone during the week? — Oh, let me remember that God commands us not to do any work on the Sabbath, and that the man who alone gathered branches on this holy day, was stoned to death by his command!” (Numbers xv. 22 to 36.)","Jean ym fuirriaght ec y thie dy yannoo red ennagh va er ny agail fegooish ve jeant ayns y chiaghtin?—O, lhig dou cooinaghtyn dy vel Jee cur sarey dooin gyn dy yannoo monney erbee dy obbyr er y doonaght, as dy row yn dooinney ren ynrycan chaglym brasnaggyn er y laa casherick shoh, er ny chlaghey gy baase liorish yn sarey echeysyn!” (Earrooyn xv. 22 gys 36.)",2
"“I will bake my bread, and buy or sell something on the Sabbath?  but don't I know how this is strictly forbidden both by the law of God and the law of the land ?  — to be permitted, by gracious care, that I may lay down this whole blessing to serve my God and save my soul. Let me, therefore, carefully get everything necessary prepared in the evening of the day before, that no worldly cares shall prevent me from keeping the holy day of the Lord.” (Ex. xx. 8.)","“Jean-ym fuinney my arran, as kionnaghey ny creck cooid erbee er y doonaght agh nagh vel fys aym dy vel shoh dy geyre er ny lhiettal chammah liorish leigh Yee as leigh yn theay ? — er ny lhiettal, lesh yn kiarail graysoil, dy vod-ym cur seose yn slane bannit shoh dy hirveish my Yee as dy hauail my annym.

"“Shall I go on the Lord’s day to the public house, and drink with drunkards, and swear with swearers? — Yes, if I wish to bring a curse upon myself and my children;—no, if I do I would destroy my health, bring my good name to ruin, and bring my household to poverty; no, if I seek heaven as my choice in the world to come!","“Jean-ym goll er laa yn Chiarn gys y thie-oast, as giu marish ny meshtallee, as loo marish ny looderyn?—Nee, my ta mee geearree dy chur lhiam mollaght orrym pene as er my chloan;—nee, my ta mee geearree dy stroie my laynt, dy chur-mow my ennym mie, as dy chur-lhiam my lught-thie gys boghtynid; nee, my ta mee geearree niurin my reih er niau ayns y theihll ta ry heet!°",3
"""Shall I leave the church because my clothes are old, and worn, and torn? but do I go there to be seen by others, or to care what others think and say ? — It is to God I owe it: and if I bring with me a broken and contrite heart, (it matters little what sort of dress I have on,) God will not despise my sacrifice.” (Ps. 17)","""Jean-ym fuirriaght veih yn keeill er yn oyr dy vel my eaddagh shenn, as ceaut, as kerrit? agh vel mee goll gys shen dy ve er ny akin liorish feallagh elley, ny dy chur tastey da shen ta sleih elley smooinaght as gra?—She rish Jee t’ayms dy yannoo: as my ta mee cur lhiam marym cree brisht as arryssagh, (cha vel eh jeh veg y scansh cre 'n sorch dy eaddagh t’orrym,) cha jean Jee beg y hoiaghey jeh my oural.” (Ps. li. 17.)",3
"“Shall I use my children as an excuse for neglecting the service of God ? Let me bring the people with me; let me show them the way; let me prove to them by my example, that neither sickness nor storm can keep me from the place of tabernacle, and where my soul finds strength from God himself, to wait for his blessing. Oh, let me always keep in remembrance, that I must give help to God for the assistance lest my absence from the church, whether in the morning or in the evening, makes to those around me!”","“Jean-ym my lughthie y yannoo my leshtal son mee-rioose y yannoo er shirveish Yee ?

"“Furthermore, who can tell whether I shall have another Sabbath to spend in this world? Next Sunday may be my last Sunday, and I may never hear the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ again. And will I stay away from the church, with death and judgment at hand, with heaven or hell before me? Would I allow some vain excuse? I would be ashamed to make a worldly friend spoil me of the only thing left for me to draw near to God in his own house? Oh, what would a soul or two give for one  hour after death, for the Sabbaths and sermons of those of which people think so little.”","“Ny sodjey, quoi oddys ginsh bee doonaght elley aym dy cheau s’y theihll shoh ?

"Is it too much for me to go to the church twice in the day of the LORD, to seek my God which hath given me all the days of my life? Who knoweth whether I go in the morning or in the evening from the service of God that I cannot. lose the benefit of some gift from God that is in a special way suitable for me? Who knows? that the minister cannot be led to speak a word proper to my state; some truth from the Scriptures, which may search my conscience; some tender counsel, that can comfort my heart, some bright sight of the Saviour, that can make him dear to my soul?”","Vel eh ro vennick dy gholl daa cheayrt gys y cheeill er laa yn Chiarn, dy arkiaght er y Jee shen ta coyrt dou dy chooilley laa jeh my vea?

"Oh therefore, let nothing be found that shall not stand in the day of judgment, let nothing be done except by sickness or any other cause, sent my way by the providence of God, to keep me at home. when the bell invites me to come to the church!” (Heb. x.25.)","“Oh er y fa shen, ny lhig da leshtal erbee nagh jean shassoo ec laa ny briwnys, ny lhig da nhee erbee er-lhimmey jeh chingys ny oyr fondagh erbee elley, er ny choyrt my raad liorish ard-chiarail Yee, mee y reayll ec y thie. tra ta yn chlag dy my chuirrey dy heet gys y cheeill!” (Heb. x.25.)",4
"And now, Brethren, what more can I say, but to offer my earnest prayers at the throne of grace, that the eyes of God may always be upon our Church for good! that his blessing may be abundantly upon the congregation that is gathered together there ! that the true way might be preached unto you, and received by you ! that we may all be led into the way of truth, and keep the faith in the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace and righteous life!”","As nish Vraaraghyn, cre sodjey t’aym dy ghra, agh dy hebbal my phadjeryn jeean ec y stoyl recoil dy ghrayse, dy vod sooillyn Yee ve dy kinjagh er nyn Agglish son foays! dy vod e vannaght  ve dy palchey er ny gheayrtey yn cheshaght t’er ny haglym cooidjagh ayns shen ! dy vod yn sushtal firrinagh er ny phreacheil lioryms, as dy creeoil er ny ghoaill lieriuish ! dy vod mayd ooilley ve er nyn leeideil gys raad ny firriney, as yn credjue y reayll ayns unnaneys y spyrryd ayns kiangley’n chee, as ayns ynrickys bea !”",4
