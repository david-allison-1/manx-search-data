"Ta yn ellan ain hene ynrycan boayl feer beg, as er-y-fa shen tyn Gailck Manninagh soit beg jeh liorish adsyn nagh vel toiggal da vel ee, dy firrinagh, unnane jeh ny shinney glaaraghyn[1] ’sy theill; y glaare shuyr jeh Gailck Erinagh as Gailck Albinagh, as vooinjer faggys jeh Bretnish.","Our own island is ony a very small place, and therefore Manx Gaelic is looked down upon by those that do not understand that it is, truly, one of the oldest languages in the world; the sister langaug of Irish Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic and the a close relation of Welsh.",[1] shinney glaaraghyn] would expect; [glaaraghyn shinney]
"Va ny glaaragyn shoh er ny loayrt trooidmaght ny ellanyn shoh—unnane jeu ayns balley-beg cheerey mygeayrt Cronk Ludgate foddey dy ’hraa roish ny laaghyn Julius Cæsar, as sheelogheyn gyn earoo roish va Baarle er ny ruggey.","These languages were spoken throughout these islands — one of them in the cillage around Ludgate Hill a long time before the days of Julius Caesar, and inumerable generations before English was born. We are going to hear to songs that were created hundreds of years ago, and sung in the language of the creators.",
"Ta shin goll dy clashton da arraneyn v’er ny croit keedyn dy bleeantyn er dy henney[2], as er ny ghoaill ayns glaare ny fercrooyn.",,"[2] dy clashton da arraneyn v’er ny croit keedyn dy bleeantyn er dy henney] whilst the intended meaning is quite evident, would expect; [dy chlashtyn daa arrane v’er ny chroo keeadyn dy vleeantyn er dy henney]. (It was common to use third person singular constructions such as ‘er ny chroo’ for all persons in the late 19thC and early 20thC)."

"Ta shiu myrgeddin goll dy clashtyn da shenn greinyn kiaulee, as dy jeeagh er gleashaghey[4] aalin jey aegid maynrey, myr ren ny ayraghyn ain ayns ny shenn traayn.","You are also going to harken to ancient musical instruments, and to observe beautiful movement of happy youth, as our parents did in the old times.",[4] gleashaghey] text; [gleasherghy]
"Mraane seyrey as deiney seyrey voish Chesaghtyn kinney, ta me goaill boggey dy cur shee-dy-vea diu, ayns chengey ny mayrey Ellan Vannin.","Ladies and Gentlemen from related Societies, I am enjoying giving you a welcome, in the native language of the Isle of Man.",
