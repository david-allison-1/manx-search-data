Cattlestock herdsman was Paddy’s trade and chasing away the heifers from the pitfalls. He’d be going away Monday morning and staying the whole week until the Saturday night. He’d bring a packet of food with him that would do the whole week.

So, the neighbours went to search for him on Sunday morning in good time and as they were wandering through the hills they found a dead man in a bog in a pool of water, and his face had changed so much that they couldn’t say if it was Paddy or not, but they were satisfied that is was Paddy when he hadn’t come home as usual, and brought the dead man home to Judy, and they gave him a good wake and drank plenty of whisky over him for days before they buried him. And when he was put under the ground, Tall, Small Monty the Redhead came to ask Judy would she marry him as soon as the body was out of sight. Judy was willing enough she said if Dad would allow it, because it was a short time since Paddy was buried. ","Haink un oie jesarn as cha daink Paddy thie eck yn oie myr ve claghtey.

So, Monty came to the house and he told Dad what the reason was for him coming; that Judy and himself had made up their minds to get married that afternoon. However, Dad said that that wouldn’t do, that they would be forced to postpone the marriage for days under the shadow of shame. But Monty said that Judy had a fat pig and that she would give the pig to him for marrying them that afternoon, and when Dad heard about the pig he said to Monty to go and get Judy and that he would marry them for the pig. ",Doyrt Monty dy jannagh eh gholl dy vriagh jeh Jeg.

And Dad was to come in the night to get the pig when they wouldn’t be seeing him out of the barn. So, Monty and Judy went home and after supper they went to their bedroom.

","     Now we will leave Monty and Judy for a while, and tell what happened to Paddy. When he was tending the livestock on the hills in the afternoon a message came from his aunt that she was dying and that she wanted to see him. Now his aunt’s dwelling was several miles off and Paddy was expecting to be named in her will, and he made as much haste as he could. He didn’t have time to go to tell Judy where he had gone. He was in full haste because he was expecting a handful after her death. So, Paddy went to his aunt’s house without saying anything to anyone. When he arrived there his aunt was well bad, nevertheless, she didn’t die for days after he came and he stayed until she was dead and buried. And he wasn’t able to let Judy know what was delying him. ","Nish nee mayd faigail Monty as judy son son tammyl. As ginsh c’red ren taggyrt da Paddy.

It was a long journey, and Paddy was tired and worn out and it was late at night when he came to the door of his house and he made a lot of noise because he was in a hurry to go to bed. And at last Judy shouted “Who is it?”","Agh tra va ooilley harrish as y Naunt curryt fo yn sod haink eh er y yurnaa thie fastyr yn laa vee onluckyt eck yn thie as shen jesarn van jurnaa louyr, as va Paddy skee as tulyt as amnagh er yn oie tra haink eh gys dorrys y hie as ren eh lane sheen son ve ayns siyr dy ghoal dy lhie.

In the end, he went to the barn and lay down in the straw with the pig, and he was asleep in a short while. But he wasn’t long asleep until the pig started shouting and Paddy woke and he saw a man putting a rope around the pig’s neck, and he got up to stop him from taking the pig away, and when the man saw Paddy he ran away as fast as he could. Then Paddy lay down again and slept ’til it was morning.",agh cha row cheet dy oslley ny-yeih as ve ghoaill yindys mooar cred va er jeet er judy.

When Paddy got up in the morning it was high time to go to church and the neighbours were going in a hurry. Paddy didn’t have time to have breakfast, or he would be late for church and when he came out of the barn the people started running and Paddy ran after them wondering what they were running for, until they came into the church in a hurry. Dad asked them what they were running for. They said that Paddy’s ghost was running after them. “It’s not you he wants, but me!” said Dad. And he got out through another door and the people also ran (that) way and Paddy after them, until some of them got tired and waited until Paddy came to them, and then they told him what they were running for, because they thought he was his ghost. When Dad saw it was Paddy himself and how everything happened, he went to Paddy’s house and he married Paddy and Judy anew, and chased Small, Tall Monty the Redhead away about his business.","Va jeg booiagh dy liooar gheddyn ersooyl fegooish yn Vuck son ve ayns aggle mooar rosh scaa Paddy.
