She had brought the food for their dinner. There  was a full bowl of milk, and some breadcrumbs broken into it.

She went to wake Augustus. But he wasn’t to be found under the tree. “The good child is gone to his work again with the basket.” she said with joy. Unfortunately, she was far from thinking what accident had arisen. She went to the house, then she came back to spread the net on the grass. After a spell of time, the child hadn’t come. She started to fear that something had happened to him, and she set out to search the forest, that was three miles in length and about half as wide.

They were all sharing in her sorrow, and her brother was as sad as she was, yet, no one at all saw the child. But they all took it upon themselves to go with her to search the forest.
