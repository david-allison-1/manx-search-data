","     I’ve heard of a truly mighty man who was once going through the countries, challenging every man for a fight, wrestle or runing race. The people were calling him ‘Iron Bones’. If there wasn’t a man in the land who could fight, wrestle or race him that land would be subjected to tax for him.","Ta mee er clashtyn jeh dooinney feer niarthal va cheayrt gholl trooid ny cheeraghyn, curt y lane fo dy chooilley ghooinney son chaggey gleck ny roie. va’n sleih gillagh eh crauyn yarn As myr nagh row dhoinney ayns yn cheer foddagh chaggey gleck ne roie rish vagh yn cheer shen fo keesh da’ ",

","     On his travels, he came to Ireland, and he went to the house of the Irish king to see if there was any man in his army, or in his kingdom, who would attempt to fight, wrestle or race him. ",er yn throalt eck eh haink eh gys Nherin. As hie eh gys thie yn Ree yernagh dy yeaghyn row dhoinney erbee ayns y hcshaght-chaggee ne ayns reeraght yannagh ghoaill ayns laue dy chaggey gleck ne roie rish. ,

","    The King said that he didn’t have one who would fight or wrestle him, but maybe he would find one to race him. Then the King went in a hurry to look for Kit McKulyn, the fastest footman that there was in Ireland, to get him to run with Iron Bones. ","Doyrt yn Ree nagh row unnane eck eh yannagh chaggey ny gleck rish, agh foddee dy vogh eh fer dy roie rish Eisht hie yn Aree ayns siyr dy yeeaghyn son Kit McKulyn yn coshee s’beau v’ayns Nherin, dy gheddyn eh dy roie marish crauyn yarn.

Iron Bones asked him what his name was. “The Muddy Coat Boddagh” he said.","Haink crauyn yarn dy akin yn dhoinney, agh cha row eh feer taitnysagh er gholl dy akin yn dhoinney, agh cha row eh feer taitnysagh roie marish vrie crauyn yarn jeh cred v’an ennym eck eh Boddagh yn quoit lechagh doyrt eh’ ",

They were going to bed down in the forest until the morning and Iron Bones lay beneath the promentary of a rock, but the Boddagh broke branches off the trees and made a shelter for himself. Out in the night a sound came past that woke Iron Bones, and he saw the Boddagh chasing after a wild pig. He caught it in a short while and lit a fire and grilled the pig. When the pig was ready for eating, he came to invite Iron Bones to supper with him, but he wasn’t wanting anything, so the Boddagh ate one half himself and went off then the find a drink. And before daylight came he ate the other half of the pig.","V’an roie dy ghoaill toshaght eck brishey yn laa laa ny vairagh vad gholl dy lie ayns yn cheyll er gys yn voghrey as ren crauyn yarn lhie fo ghob creg agh ren yn Boddagh brishey banglanyn jeh ny biljyn as jannoo fastee da hene.

The Boddagh came to a valley where there were many blackberries growing and he began to pick blackberries, and, as many as he wasn’t able to eat, he was putting them in his pockets until the pockets were full and Iron Bones came into sight, then the Boddagh started running again. The pockets of his coat were full of blackberries and their weight ripped the coat and they fell on the way, but the Boddagh didn’t notice that they were lost until he put a hand in to get a fistfull. Then he went to look for his pockets until he met Iron Bones, and he asked him if he saw his pockets. “Nope.” said Iron Bones, “but I saw two sacks about four miles behind me.”","fy yerrey ren yn laa brishey, as ghow ad toshagh dy roie As ayns tra gherryd va crauyn yarn faagyt ny chooyl haink yn boddagh gys choan raad va ymmydee smair ghoo gaase as ghow eh toshaght dy hoie smair, as wheesh as nagh row eh son gee ve cur ad ayns y foggadyn gys va ny poggadyn lane as ren crauyn yarn cheet ayns shilley, esh ren yn boddaght roie reesht. va poddadyn yn quoit ec eh lane smair as ren yn trymmyd ock raipey yn quoit as ren ad tuittym er yn raaid, agh cha ren yn boddagh ghennaghtyn dy row ad callyt gys chur y laue ayn dy gheddyn lane dhorn esht ren eh gholl dy yeaghyn son y foggadyn gys veet eh crauyn yarn, as vrie eh jeh ren eh fakin y foggadyn. cha ren doyrt crauyn yiarn, agh honnick mee daa hack mysh kair veeiley er my chooyl.

","     The Boddagh went on until he found his pockets and then he ran without further delay, until he was leading Craueyn Yiarn, and at the end of the journey he found some oat sheaves and mixed the blackberries among them and ate it all as Iron Bones was going on board the ship. Then the Boddagh put his foot against the end of it and pushed it out of the harbour.
