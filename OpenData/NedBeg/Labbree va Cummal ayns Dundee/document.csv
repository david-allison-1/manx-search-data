And those men are pretty often in a pub, wasting their money. This labourer was one night lying with his wife and when he woke in the morning he was in a very despondent state. He said to his wife that he had seen in a dream a really big, fat rat coming to meet him, and two rats, very thin, following after it and last of all there was a big blind rat coming and he the wife couldn't give any explanation of the dream and he was very downcast in his mind, because he had heard it wasn’t a good dream to see rats. And he was in fear that an accident was going to befall him. He had a small son, and when he heard his father telling the dream he said that he would give an explanation of it, and he did so like this: “The big rat you saw is the man who lives in the pub where you spend your time so often. And the two thin rats are me and my mother. And the blind rat is yourself, my father.” I reckon that that is a very good explanation of the dream.","Ren mee lheih jeh labbree va coammal ayns Dundee. ve labragh er raid ny fainee aileagh.

A quiet spot without noise, without people talking would make better to think about things that are sometimes coming into my mind when I’m sitting down to write, but when I have to leave it is all gone when I come back. I got a cowhide from Mr Wood this week, to make carranes (traditional Manx leather footwear, made with the hair-side on the outside, with the fur left on) for him and I must take a turn to them. He wants other things, but I don’t know how I can send him things like flails and a hedge spade, they’re too long to send them by post. Good night, and safe sleep.","Cha vel monney shee aym dy scrieu ny cheayrtyn ta mee eginyt cha mennick dy aagail e ayns y vean esh ta mee jarroos cre va mee scrieu, yannagh boayl feagh fegooish sheean gyn sleih thaggloo jannoo ny share dy smooinaght er reddyn.
