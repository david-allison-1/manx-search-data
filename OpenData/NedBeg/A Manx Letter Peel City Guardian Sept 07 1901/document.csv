If you have any other Manx writings, I would be grateful if you would send them to me. I am coming to see you again. I am only learning Manx, so you must not make fun of me.","—Gur eh mie oo son yn Skeeal Manninagh as yn “Drane.” G'liak lhiam ad dy mie. My ta veg dy screnyn Gaelg elley ayd, veign booiagh my yinnagh Oo cur ad dooys. Ta mee cheet dy chur shilley ort reesht. Ta mish ynrican gynsagh Gaelg, myr shen cha nhegin dhyt yannoo faghid j’eem.","Ta mish ynrican gynsagh Gaelg— This is clearly a word for word translation of the English ‘I am only learning Manx’, but it is not an accurate translation as it really means ‘I alone am learning Manx’. Cha nel mee agh goaill toshiaght gynsagh Gaelg— ‘I am but starting to learn Manx’, might be the expected translation."
