Manx,English
"Ta’n Ghailck eiyrit ass yn Jiass,",Manx is driven out of the South
"As gyn monney share er y Twoaie,",And not much better in the North
Ta’n coamrey eck fritlagh as rasst,"Her clothing ragged and torn,"
Lesh clamberagh harrish ny cleiyee,From clambering over the hedges
Smooinaght nish er y traa t’er n’gholl shaghey,Thinking now on time that has passed
Va ferrishyn çheet ayns nyn thieyn,There were fairies coming into our houses
Son fastee ayns feayraght as fliaghey,For shelter in cold and rain
Nish soie ayns yn tramman as drine,Now sitting in the elder tree and thorn tree.
