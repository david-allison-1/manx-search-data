He sat down beside a little river under the shadow of a very large tree, to take his ease for a while. He had brought some boiled rice and some milk with him for his dinner but all at once he thought he would bathe in the river before having his dinner. So, he put the food on the ground and he took a rope out of his coat, and he tied the goat and the monkey to the tree, thinking that all was safe enough; he left them. But as soon as he was out of sight the monkey started to stretch and to strive to be getting the bag which held the food. As soon as he reached it he started to eat it, and he ate most of the food. And then he rubbed his hands in the goat’s beard. "," va’n laa feer aalin as chea.

When the man came back he willingly released the goat and the monkey and then he thought about his dinner – because he was now ready for it. However, when he opened the bag, there was only a very little bit.","Va’n mitchooar jeaghyn feer imlee esht ny hoie ayns yn boayl ren y vainshtyr faigail e eck lhattir yn villey.
