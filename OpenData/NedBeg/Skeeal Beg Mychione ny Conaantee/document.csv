"," It is written about the covenantors, the people called that in the days of Charles the Second, when the covenantors were forbidden to worship God in accordance with his word, by the King and his officers, and they were forced to worship amongst the remote mountains in Scotland and in the glens, with watchmen on the high hills, to give a warning when the soldiers were in view.

He was called Alexander Peden, and often Peden the Prophet of the Lord. He said; “This is the day of your enemies, to whom time and power have been allowed. They need not be idle, but do you have any other work for them to do in the service of their Master? Send those chasing them to those to whom you have given the strength to flee, for our strength is gone, and there are many feeble women amongst us today. Return out from around the mountains, O Lord, and cast a shadow from your cloak over old Sandy and the poor things, and save us this one time.” ","Va ooilley yn çheshaght cha feagh as yn baase ayns thullagh, gys ren corraa un dooinney brishey yn shee, ve ennmyssit Alexander Pedan, as mennick Pedan yn Phadeyr Çhiarn, dooyrt eh, “Shoh laa dy noidyn.
