","     There once was a priest who got into financial difficulties, not on purpose, and it wasn’t his own fault, and he was greatly sorry about it. And he was taking it the Lord in prayer day after day, for a spell of time, but no answer was forthcoming. In the end, he asked his wife to pray with him, but she refused. She said that she couldn’t do that because, she was sure of it, that God would give them everything that would be for their benefit, without praying to him for it. ","Va Saggyrt cheayrt ren gheddyn ayns lhastynyn cha ne jeh y yoin, as cha row eh yn fooyl eck hene. As ve ayns seaghyn mooar mygheayrt y mysh.

Then she prayed with all her heart that God would help and send them money to pay the debt. As soon as this was done, the Lord sent help to them. The priest went out in the street and a friend met him that he hadn’t seen for many years, and he asked the priest if he needed any prosperity assistance at all, and he reached out his hand to him and gave him just the amount of money that was paying the debt. So, a prayer was answered in a wonderful way, and God glorified..","Dooyrt y sheshey ree dy row Jee gra shir shiu as nee shiu gheddyn. Ren yn ven vee esh fakin dy row ee er shaghryn as ghoaill rish.
