","“I dreamt,” he said “that I saw a very large and fat rat coming to meet me and following him were two others, very thin, and last of all there was a blind one coming following them.” The labourer was well downcast in his mind, because he was reckoning that some evil was close-by. He had heard that dreaming about rats was very bad and that some misfortune was to befall him. In vain he asked of his wife to give an explanation of the vision— because she couldn’t do that. ","Ren mee dreamal doyrt e dy ren mee fakin roddan feer vooar as rouyr cheet dy veeitteil mee as er y iyrt va jeese elley, feerthanney as er jerrey ooilley va unnane doal cheet giyrt orroo va’n labbree cheaut sheesh dy mie ayns y aigney, son ve coontey dy row olk ennagh ergerrey.

And the two that were so thin are me and and my mother. And the blind one is you yourself father.” ",va mac aig eck eh gilley beg feer tastagh.
