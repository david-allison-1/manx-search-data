And there was a very rich baron living in a castle on a hill close to the forest. Max was striving to make a livelihood for himself and his family as well as he could. In the winter he used to cut heavy loads of wood for fire; and pull them up onto the hill, over the road covered with snow, to the Baron’s castle. The Baron had always been a good friend to Max and his family and Max would have done anything in the world for the Baron. The Baron had one daughter called Olga who was very beautiful and sweet, and who they were calling ‘flower of the forest’. And everyone loved her.

Upon coming home one afternoon, tired and hungry, Lady Olga didn’t run to meet him as she usually did. “Where is Olga?” said the Baron, but nobody knew because Olga, and her companion Vera, were away out of their sight for quite a while. They searched for them in every place, but the ladies couldn’t be found anywhere. “This is the work of my enemy” said the Baron, “the Count has stolen my daughter, flower of the forest, I must go to search for her and her companion.”","Un cheayrt va’n Barron er ve ersooyl shelg son three laa.
