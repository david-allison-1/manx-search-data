","Bethany was close to Jerusalem and there was a family living in it of two sisters and a brother. The sisters were called Martha and Moirrey (Mary) and the brother; Lazarus. A messenger was sent by the sisters to Christ praying him to help them, because their sick brother Lazarus was dying. Nevertheless, Christ waited two days longer where he was, for the reason that that which he was designed to do could be of greater glory for God; when Jesus reached Bethany and found out that Lazarus was four days dead and buried.

","     When Martha got news that Jesus was near she immediately left her sister with some Jews, who had come from Jerusalem to console them for (the loss of) their brother, and she ran to Jesus. She said to him that if he would have been there her brother would have still been alive. But she professed that she believed; that Christ was the Son of the Living God, and whatever he would ask of God, that God would grant his petition to him, that he was designed to be the Saviour of the world.

"," Esht ren ee goaill y shuyr dy lhattie, as gra ree dy row Chreest er jeet as dy row eh yeerree dy akin ee. Er shen ren Moirrey girree seose ayns siyr as roie gys Yeesey. "

","     When the Jews, who had come to console her, saw her getting up and going out they were thinking that she was going to the grave to mourn. Then they got up and followed her. ","Tra ren ny hewnyn va er jeet dy gherjagh ee fakin ee girree seose as gholl magh, vad coointey dy row ee gholl gys yn oaie dy ghobberan esht ren ad girree as gholl er y eiyrt. "

","     When they came to Jesus, and when he saw them all in tears, he was sorrowful and he wept, and he asked them where he was buried. He was soon led to the grave. He said to them to take the stone away from the grave, and he prayed to God. ","Tra haink ad gys Yeesey, as tra ren eh fakin ad ooilley ayns jeir , Ve seaghnyt as ren eh keayney.

Come out!” and immediately the dead arose and came out in grave shrouds and a scarf around his face. Then Jesus said that it was God’s unbinding, and let him through. ","Ny lurg, shen ren eh geamagh lesh ard corraa Lazarus tar magh, as cheleeragh ren yn marroo girree as cheet magh ayns aanrityn oanluckee as bussal mysh y eddyn.

","     This resurrection is an analogy for us of the soul, that turns from death to life. Christ talks to the soul as he did to Lazarus, calling with a loud voice when it is dead in sin, by means of the Word and works of the holy spirit, waking it to repentence, and making it fruitfull in good works.","Va’n irree reesht shoh cosolagh doinyn, jeh yn annym, ta chynda voish baase gys bea.

","     The tears and pleading, and prayers, show how difficult it is to revive those who are dead, in transgressions and sin, but however difficult it is, let us not despair. When we think about the almighty voice that makes the dead rise up from the grave, and with a word brings the clay to life.","Ta ny jeir, as yn ackan, as padjeryn, jeaghyn cre cha dhollee, as te ahvioghey adsyn ta marroo, ayns loghtyn as peccah agh cre er bee cha dhollee as te, Ny lhig doin jannoo mee credjue.
