Chreest ta er choyrt graih dou as ren cur eh hene er my hon.*    ,     Christ who has given me love and gave himself for me. 
"     Tra ren yn Noo Paul screeu ny goan shoh t’eh jeeaghyn dy ren eh gennaghtyn, son thullagh, myr dy beagh eh yn ynrican peccagh ayns yn slane seihll as myr nagh row Creest er gheddyn baase son fer erbee elley, agh eh hene. Va e chree (cha) lane jeh’n ghraih yindyssagh as myghin va’n Er-kionnee bannit er hoilshaghey dasyn, yn ard drogh yantagh, dy ren eh coayl shilley jeh dy chooilley unnane elley as geamagh magh “ren Mac Yee cur graih dou as cur eh hene er my hon”. ","     When Saint Paul wrote these words he shows that he felt, for a moment, as if he were the only sinner in the whole world and as if Christ had not died for anyone else at all, except himself. His heart was (so) full of the wonderful love and mercy that the blessed Redeemer had revealed to him, the arch sinner, that he lost sight of everyone else and called out “the Son of God gave me love and gave himself for me”.

"     Vel shiu dy mennick smooinniagh myr shoh er fuill chostlagh Yeesey? Ny vel shiu jeant magh lesh jeeaghyn er foddey eddyr ny cheayrtyn? Vel shiu dy bragh goaill ayrnyn jeh yn ghoo, myr yn ayrn ta nish kiongoyrt riu as soieagh nyn aigney er as streeu dy hoiggal, as dy vlastyn eh. ","Are you often thinking like this about Jesus’ precious blood? Or, are you satisfied with looking at it very infrequently? Are you eternally taking parts of the word, like the part that is now before you, and setting your mind to it and striving to understand, and to taste it? "
"     Myr ta’n sniaghtey lhie er errooyn yn vaghyr as lheie ersooyl gour y traa as meelagh yn ooir, myr shen lhisagh shin lhiggey da ayrnyn jeh yn ghoo lhie er nyn greeaghyn, gys nee mayd blastyn y viljyd, as goaill ny focklyn dy ve dy slane lhien hene . ","     As the snow lies on the ploughmen of the fields and melts away all the while and and softens the soil, so we should allow parts of the Word to lie on our hearts, until we taste the sweetness and take the words to be completey (one) with ourselves. "
"     Mac Yee chur graih dou as ren choyrt eh hene er my hon. O cre’n gioot costal va shoh.

","     The Son of God who gave me love and gave himself for me. Oh what a precious gift this was. Have you ever been thinking how much the blessed Saviour gave for us when he gave himself, and took the terrible weight of our sins on his own soul, on the cross?"
"     Yn Saualtagh deyr, te’r choyrt graih diu as er choyrt eh hene er nyn son, ta shin graihagh ersyn, er yn oyr dy row shin graihaghit orrinyn hoshaght.

When my heart grows cold and my love for Jesus grows slow and weak, let me come to the place that is called Calvary and in there see the love of the Son of God who gave himself for me."
