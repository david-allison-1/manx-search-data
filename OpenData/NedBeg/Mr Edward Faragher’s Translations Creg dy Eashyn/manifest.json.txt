	A translation of ‘Rock of Ages’, Augustus M. Toplady, The Gospel Magazine (UK), March 1777.\n
	(See 127, and 168 (???) ‘Rock of Ages Cleft for Me for diplomatic transcriptions, normalised versions and translations of ‘Rock of Ages’, written in Neg Beg’s own hand.)\n
	The second verse of this Manx version does not exactly match either verse 2 or 3 of the English original. The second verse in the Manx may be translated as 'I could cry night and day, I could beseech with much zeal, that which I could not now improve, It is You who must save me. Without a gift in this earthly world, Only holding to the cross.'",
