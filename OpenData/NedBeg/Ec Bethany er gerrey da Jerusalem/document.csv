","At Bethany near to Jerusalem there was a family living who Christ knew very well. There were two sisters called martha and Mary, and their brother, Lazarus. A message was sent to Christ for help because their brother Lazarus was mortally ill. Yet, Jesus stayed two days longer where he was then, so that that which he was intended to do could be greater to the glory of God. ","Eck Bethany ergerrey da Jerusalem, Va lughthie commal.

Martha, when she knew that Christ was near, she ran to him right away, leaving her sister Mary with several Jews who had come from Jerusalem to console her about her brother. Martha pronounced her sadness that if only Christ had been there then her brother would not have died. Yet, she made an assurance that had he  been still alive and, she was believing, that if he (had)  prayed to God to revive him, that that would have been done. She acceted that he was Christ the son of the living god, who was intended to come to the world. Then she went straight away and she told her sister, that Christ had come, and desired to see her. With that, Moirrey rose up and ran to Jesus. "," Tra ren Yeesey rostyn Bathaney hoor eh magh dy row Lazarus kair laa marroo as onlyckyt.

","The conditional dependent form dy beagh would be expected here, rather than the simple past dependent dy row – which mimics English grammar. Examples like this are more commonly found in Ned Beg’s translated pieces."

","     When the Jews who had come to console her saw her in a hurry, they thought that she was, in her great sadness, going to the grave to mourn there. They followed her. When Jesus saw Moirrey and the Jews who who with her in tears, he also shed tears and he asked them where they had put him. He was straight away led to the grave.

","     He ordered them to take the stone away, then he prayed for a short while and he called with a loud voice, “Lazarus! Come out!” and straight away the dead rose and came out in grave cloths and a scarf tied about his face. Jesus told to them to release him, and let him go.

Christ calls to our souls with a loud voice when we are dead in sin. By his word and the workings of the Holy Spirit that awakens to repentence and make us fruitful in good deeds. The prayers, the lamentation and the tears show us what difficulty there is in waking those who are dead in transgressions and sin. Yet, however difficult it is, we must not lose faith when we are thinking of the voice of the almighty, who makes the dead to rise from the grave, and with a word, to revive the cold clay.","Ta shoh cosoalagh jeh yn irree reesht.
