They would say that he was a witch, and that he went in the image of the three legs and rolled around the Isle of Man from one end to the other end, like the rim of a great wheel, and that one day he rolled out on the sea from Jurby point and that he was never seen after that.

The form of spelling  used in the ‘normalised’ versions in this collection is based on that given in the poem ‘Seeing Mona Again’, although this is likely only E.U. Savage’s preferred spelling, and perhaps not reflective of modern scholarship. Where Ned Beg uses the variant, the spelling Manninagh, has been used."

He thought about the blackberries, and he put his hand in the pocket of the pocket of his coat to take a fistful, but the pocket was gone. Then he put his hand in the other pocket, but that poscket was gone too. The weight of the blackberries ripped the pockets out of the coat and they were lost on the route, and he didn’t realise that they were lost until he put his hands in them. Then he said to himself that he would be hungry before he would reach the end of the journey, and that it would be better for him to go to look for his pockets.

So the brought him the bag of oat groats and the big vessel to put the groats in, then he poured the grouts into the vessel and emptied the pockets of blackberries in it too, and mixed them all together, then he started to eat with two hands, very greedily, until he saw Iron Bones coming very slowly, and pretty well lame.
