","     There is a home in Germany for orphans that don’t have friends to do anything for them. When a new child is taken in, the first thing they do to him; take a photograph of him so that if he becomes proud, when he grows up, that he can be humbled when he sees what a filthy and ragged child he once was. And like that, is it necessary for us to look behind us. The Bible has taken our picture clear enough, and here it is; dead in trespasses and sin, that is the picture we were once in, and as it humbles us. Let it also fill our hearts with joy and acknowledgment, and our mouths with songs of praise to our mighty redeemer.","Tha thie ayns Germany cour chloan gyn Ayr, nagh vel caarjyn ock dy yannoo veg er nyn son, tra ta lhannoo noa goit stiagh yn ched red ta’d jannoo rish ghoaill castlys scanagh jeh son my nee eh gaase moarnagh, tra te gaase seose, dy vod eh ve er ny injalaghey tra the fakin cren lhannoo broogh as frytlagh ve cheayrt, as mor shen te ymmyrchagh doonyn dy yeaghyn nyn jeih.

When we were dead in trespasses and sin, he brought us back to life, and it is because Christ suffered death that those who believe in him could be made alive; for they are raised up with Christ.","Jee ta berchagh ayns myghyn son y graih wooar te er ve ch graihagh orryn. tra va shin marrow ayns loghtyn as peccah, ren eh shin y viogey, as te er yn ayr dy ren Chreest surrans baase, dy voddagh adsyn ta credjall ayn ve jeant bio son ta’d er ny hroggal seose marish Chreest "
