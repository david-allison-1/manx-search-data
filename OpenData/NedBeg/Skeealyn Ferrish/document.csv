When he’d be coming in the middle of the night, there would be hundreds of them, he said, little girls about as big as children would be starting to walk and they’d be singing with a little song, but it seems that they were short so they were the same words over and over.

","     I have been told many times about one night he was coming home from Port Erin, about midnight, and when he came to Crosh Moylley Mooar, he saw a bit gathering of people, and when he reached them it was a great army of fairies, going to ‘the supper of the horses’ to see wonders that were to be seen that night. And they invited him to go with them to see the wonderful things that were to be shown to them on Cronk Veayl near to Çhibbyr-ny-Gabbyl (The horses’ well), because strange and miraculous things were to be set up, for the wonder of all who were pleased to come to see them.

","     He had been in Dublin and Liverpool, he said, but the wonders he saw in those cities weren’t worthy to be considered in comparison with the works of art of the fairies. He had never seen such beautiful things on this Earth, but before he’d seen the half of them they told him it was time for him to go to his home because the day was dawing, and that the ladies and gentlemen had already started to leave until another night, and that he could come again to see the wonders that he hadn’t seen that night, for there were many rooms that he hadn’t seen.

So, he stood to watch what would end up happening to the house. In a short while the house lifted up in the air until it was like a cloud, and went off floating like the other clouds, until it went away over Bradda Head. And he forgot to ask what night it would be open again, but he didn’t see the house and the wonderful works ever again, and he wouldn’t forget them for as long as he lived. I’ve heard him tell of these wonders many times. A man would often be walking very late, and he was often seeing the fairies, but they never did him any harm. Since the old fairy stories are gone not even one fairy has been seen, and the old fairy stories are gone. The old men aren’t meeting in the houses as they used to, to tell stories, but the young people gather to speak English, and to tell worthless things that old people don’t take any pleasure in at all. Therefore, it’s time to go to bed, to take our rest, Goodnight, Goodnight.","Mor shen haink eh magh as yn thie as van moghrey gaase sollys. Mor shen hass eh dy yeaghyn cre’n erry harragh er yn thie.
