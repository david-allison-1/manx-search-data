SHIRVEISH ASHOONAGH Ayns Chengey ny Mayrey Ellan Vannin. SHENN KEEILL VRADDAN[1]. ,A NATIONAL SERVICE In The Mother Tongue of the Isle of Man. OLD KIRK BRADDAN.,"[1] The old parish church of Braddan is known as ‘Old Kirk Braddan’. The article mentions that so many tickets were sold for the event that the new Braddan Church was used instead of the old church, and was full to capacity. The article also mentions that the organisers believed this to be the first Manx language church service at Braddan for nearly 70 years but that this was unlikley to be true. (Indeed, Rev. William Drury, mentioned in the sermon, was a Manx speaker and Vicar of Braddan until 1887.) The article says that Manx services were held ‘in the memory of Douglas residents not past middle-age’ at the Thomas Street (now Victoria Street) Wesleyan chapel and ‘even more recently in the Western district of the Island’."

"— Toshiaght yn jeihoo Psalm as kiare-feed. “Hiarn, t’ou uss er ve nyn gemmyrk: veih sheeloghe gys sheeloghe.” S’mooar, dy jarroo, ta my voggey er yn laa tayn jiu, dy vel caa aym dy ghoaill ayrn ayns yn chirveish shoh.

","Many years have passed since the sound of our mother tongue was last heard within the hallowed walls of old Kirk Braddan from the lips of that good and kindly priest the late William Drury. Many things have happened since those days some for good, some for evil.",

","Nevertheless we are met to-day in the temlple and presence of One who has not forgotten our beloved tongue wherein prayers and songs of praise were offered to Him by men, women and children now silent in the grave.
