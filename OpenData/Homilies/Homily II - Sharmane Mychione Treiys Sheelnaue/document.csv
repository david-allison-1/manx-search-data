[3] In this homily, the margin column in the English has only the book and chapter references (suppressed in the present edition), which are spelt out more completely in the Manx text in parentheses. The Manx text has no marginalia.",1
"The Holy Ghost, in writing the Holy Scripture, is in nothing more diligent, than to pull down man’s vain-glory and pride; which, of all vices, is most universally grafted in all mankind, even from the first infection of our first father Adam.","     Cha vel yn Spyrryd Noo, ayns scrieu ny Scriptyryn Casherick, ny ’skiart ayns nhee erbee na dy injillaghey gloyr fardailagh as moyrn dooinney, ta ny smoo na peccah erbee elley frauit ayns ooilley sheelnaue, eer veih broid nyn gied Ayr Adam.",,,1
"And therefore we read, in many places of Scripture, many notable lessons against this old rooted vice, to teach us the most commendable virtue of humility, how to know ourselves, and to remember what we be of ourselves.","As shen-y-fa, shimmey raue jeean ta shin lhaih ayns ymmodee ayrnyn jeh’n Scriptyr noi yn chenn pheccah niartal shoh, dy ynsaghey dooin yn grayse smoo ymmyrchagh dy injillid-aigney, cre’n aght dy gheddyn tushtey jin hene, as dy chooinaghtyn cre ta shin jin hene.",,,1
"In the book of Genesis, Almighty God giveth us all a title and name in our great grandfather Adam; which ought to warn us all to consider what we be,[4] whereof we be, from whence we came, and whither we shall; saying thus: In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy[5] bread, till thou be turned again into the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; inasmuch as thou art dust, and into dust shalt thou be turned again. Here, as it were in a glass, we may learn to know ourselves to be but ground, earth and ashes, and that to earth and ashes we shall return.","Ayns Lioar Genesis, (cab. iii. 19), ta Jee Ooilley-niartal coyrt dooin ooilley ennym ayns nyn chenn-ayr Adam, lhisagh raue y choyrt dooin ooilley dy smooinaghtyn, jeh cre’n stoo ta shin, cre voish haink shin, as c’raad ta shin goll; loayrt myr shoh, “Ayns ollish dty vaaish nee oo gee dty arran, derrey hyndaays[6] oo gys yn ooir: son ass shen v’ou er dty ghoaill: son joan oo, as gys joan nee oo reesht chyndaa.” Ayns shoh myr ayns gless, foddee mayd gynsaghey, dy vel shin ynrican ooir as leoie, as dy jean mayd chyndaa gys ooir as joan reesht.",,"[4] what we be] omitted in the Manx.

"Also, the holy Patriarch Abraham did well remember this name and title, dust, earth, and ashes, appointed and assigned by God to all mankind: and therefore he calleth himself by that name, when he maketh his earnest prayer for Sodom and Gomorrah.","Myrgeddin ren Abraham, yn patriarch crauee, cooinaghtyn dy mie er yn ennym shoh, joan, ooir, as leoie, er ny coyrt liorish Jee gys ooilley sheelnaue: as shen-y-fa t’eh genmys. eh-.hene liorish yn ennym shen, tra t’eh chebbal seose e phadjer jeean son Sodom as Gomorrah.",,,2
"And we read that Judith, Esther, Job, Jeremy, with other holy men and women in the Old Testament, did use sackcloth, and to cast dust and ashes upon their heads, when they bewailed their sinful living.","As ta shin lhaih, ayns y Chenn Chonaant, dy ren Esther,[7] Job, as Jeremiah, marish deiney as mraane crauee elley, chur orroo aanrit-sack, as ceau joan as leoie er nyn ging, tra v’ad dobberan son nyn ymmyrkey mee-chrauee. (Job xiii. 12;[8] Jer. vi. 26; xxv. 34.)",,"[7] The Manx omits Judith; her book was not published in the Manx Apocrypha in vol. II of the Old Testament (1772).
[8] Dust is mentioned in Job xiii. 12, but Thomson remarks that a ref to Job. xlii. 6 was probably intended: Shen-y-fa ta dwoaie aym orrym pene as ta mee goaill arrys ayns joan as leoïe.",2
"They called and cried to God for help and mercy, with such a ceremony of sackcloth, dust, and ashes, that thereby they might declare to the whole world, what an humble and lowly estimation they had of themselves, and how well they remembered their name and title aforesaid, their vile, corrupt, frail nature, dust, earth, and ashes.","Ren ad geamagh as guee gys Jee son cooney as myghin, lesh aanrit-sack, as joan, as leoie; dy voddagh ad liorish shen soilshaghey da’n slane seihll, cre cha injil as v’ad ayns nyn sooillyn hene, as cre’n tastey hug ad da’n ennym roïe enmyssit, yn dooghys rnarvanagh, broghe, as annoon oc, joan, ooir, as leoie.",,,2
"The Book of Wisdom also, willing to pull down our proud stomachs, moveth us diligently to remember our mortal and earthly generation, which we have all of him that was first made; and that all men, as well kings as subjects, come into this world, and go out of the same, in like sort; that is, as of ourselves, full miserable, as we may daily see.","Ta’n Lioar dy Chreenaght myrgeddin, (cab. vii. 1), shirrey dy injillaghey yn voyrn ain, greinnaghey shin dy imneagh dy chooinaghtyn er nyn ghooghys marvanagh as thallooinagh, ta ain veihsyn va hoshiaght er ny chroo; as dy vel ooilley sheelnaue, chammah reeaghyn as y thea ta foue, cheet stiagh ’sy theihll shoh, as goll magh er yn aght cheddin; ta shin, myr j’in hene feer treih, myr ta shin gagh-laa fakin.",,,2
"And Almighty God commanded his Prophet Isaiah to make a proclamation, and cry to the whole world,: and, Isaiah asking, What shall I cry? the Lord answered, Cry, that all flesh is grass, and that all the glory thereof is but as the flower of the field:","As hug Jee Ooilley-niartal sarey da e phadeyr Isaiah, dy chur eam as dy ockley magh da’n slane seihll: as tra dooyrt Isaiah, “Cre neem geamagh?” dansoor y Chiarn, “Cur eam, dy nee faiyr dy chooilley eill, as dy vel ooilley’n aalid echey myr blaa ny magheragh.",,,2
"when the grass is withered, the flower falleth away, when the wind of the Lord bloweth upon it. The people surely is grass, the which drieth up and the flower fadeth away.","T’an faiyr fioghey, ta’n blaa tuittym; son dy vel geay yn Chiarn sheidey er. Shickyr ta’n pobble faiyr. Ta’n faiyr fioghey, ta’n blaa tuittym; agh nee Goo yn Jee ain shassoo shickyr er son dy bragh.”[9] (Is. xl. 6).","T’an faiyr fioghey, ta’n blaa tuittym; son dy vel geay yn Chiarn sheidy er. Shickyr ta’n pobble faiyr. Ta’n faiyr fioghey, ta’n blaa tuittym; agh nee Goo yn Jee ain shassoo shickyr er son dy bragh.”[9] (Is. xl. 6).","[9] The Manx completes the quotation, with the last clause of v. 8.",3
"And the holy man Job, having in himself great experience of the miserable and sinful estate of man, doth open the same to the world in these words:","As ta’n dooinney crauee Job, myr v’eh gennaghtyn ayn hene, stayd treih as peccoil deiney, fosley yn chooid cheddin da’n seihll ayns ny goan shoh:",,,3
"Man, saith he, that is born of a woman, living but a short time, is full of manifold miseries: he springeth up like a flower, and fadeth again; vanisheth away as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one state.","“Dooinney,” (as eshyn, cab. xiv. 1, 2), t’er ny ruggey jeh ben, t’eh giare-heihltagh, as lane dy hreihys: t’eh cheet seose myr blaa, as t’eh giarit sheese: t’eh chea ersooyl myrgeddin myr scadoo, as cha vel eh tannaghtyn ayns un stayd.","“Dooinney,” (as eshyn, cab. xiv. 1, 2), t’er ny ruggey jeh ben, t’eh giare-heiltagh, as lane dy hreihys: t’eh cheet seose myr blaa, as t’eh giarit sheese: t’eh chea ersooyl myrgeddin myr scadoo, as cha vel eh tannaghtyn ayns un stayd.",,3
"And dost thou judge it meet, O Lord, to open thine eyes upon such a one, and to bring him to judgment with thee? Who can make him clean, that is conceived of an unclean seed?","As vel Uss, O Hiarn, fosley dty hooillyn er y lheid, as dy my choyrt lhiam[10] ayns briwnys kiongoyrt rhyt? Quoi oddys red glen y chur lesh ass red neu-ghlen?”","As vel Uss, O Hiarn, fosley dty hoillyn er y lheid, as dy my choyrt lhiam[10] ayns briwnys kiongoyrt rhyt? Quoi oddys red glen y chur lesh ass red neu-ghlen?”","[10] lhiam] Thomson points at the lhiat would be expected. But it is lhiam in the Bible. Christopher Lewin suggests (p.c.) ‘ Perhaps confusion with the passive construction er my choyrt lhiam, where there is a strong tendency for lesh to agree with the patient rather than the agent.’",3
"And all men, of their evilness, and natural proneness, be so universally given to sin, that, as the Scripture saith, God repented that ever he made man.","Cha vod fer erbee.[11] As ta ooilley sheelnaue, jeh nyn ghooghys peccoil, cha aarloo gys olk, dy “ghow Jee arrys (myr ta’n Scriptyr gra,) dy ren eh rieau dooinney y chroo.”",,"[11] Again the Manx supplements with the last sentence of v. 4, though set outside the “ ”, rather than inside.",3
"And by sin his indignation was so much provoked against the world, that he drowned all the world with Noah’s flood, except Noah himself and his little household.","As liorish peccah, va e yymmoose wheesh er ny vrasnaghey noi yn seihll, dy ren eh ooilley yn seihll y vaih liorish y thooilley, erlhimmey jeh Noah hene as e lught-thie. (Gen. vii. 23.)","As liorish peccah, va e ymmoose wheesh er ny vrasnaghey noi yn seihll, dy ren eh ooilley yn seihll y vaih liorish y thooilley, erlhimmey jeh Noah hene as e lught-thie. (Gen. vii. 23.)",,3
"It is not without great cause that the Scripture of God doth so many times call all men here in this world by this word, earth. O thou earth, earth, earth, saith Jeremiah, hear the word of the Lord.","Cha nee dyn oyr dy vel Scriptyr Yee cha mennic geamagh er ooilley sheelnaue ’sy theihll shoh liorish yn fockle shoah, Ooir: “O ooir, ooir, ooir, (ta Jeremiah gra, xxii. 29), clasht rish goo yn Chiarn.”",,,3
"This our right name, calling and title – earth, earth, earth – pronounced by the prophet, sheweth what we be indeed, by whatsoever other style, title, or dignity men do call us. Thus He plainly named us, who knoweth best, both what we be, and what we ought of right to be called.","Ta shoh, nyn ennym cairagh, “Ooir, ooir, ooir,” soilshaghey cre ta shin ayns firrinys, liorish cre erbee yn ennym ooasle elley ta sleih genmys shin. Myr shoh ren eshyn dy baghtal genmys shin, share va toiggal echey cre ta shin, as liorish cre’n ennym lhisagh shin v’er nyn eam.",,,3
"And thus he setteth us forth, speaking by his faithful Apostle St. Paul: All men, Jews and Gentiles, are under sin: there is none righteous, no, not one.","As myr shoh, t’eh soiaghey shin magh, loayrt liorish e Ostyl firrinagh, y Noo Paul: “Ta ooilley sheelnaue, Hewnyn as Ashoonee, fo peccah; cha vel fer hene ta jannoo dy mie, cha vel unnane.",,,4
"There is none that understandeth; there is none that seeketh after God: they are all gone out of the way; they are all unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no, not one.",[12],,"[12] It is likely that this sentence was omitted from the Manx, the translator’s, or the printer’s, eye having skipped from the first cha vel unnane ‘no, not one’ to the second.",4
Their throat is an open sepulchre: with their tongues they have used craft and deceit; the poison of serpents is under their lips; their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction and wretchedness are in their ways; and the way of peace have they not known: there is no fear of God before their eyes.,Ta’n scoarnagh oc oaie foshlit: lesh nyn jengey t’ad er chliaghtey molteyrys: ta pyshoon ard-nieughyn fo nyn meillyn: ta’n beeal oc laane dy ghueeaghyn as dy herriuid: ta ny cassyn oc gastey dy gheayrtey fuill: ta toyrt-mow as treihys ayns nyn raaidyn; as raad y chee cha bione daue: cha vel aggle Yee eddyr roish nyn sooillyn.” (Rom. iii. 13–18).,,,4
"And in another place St. Paul writeth thus; God hath wrapped all nations in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all. ","As ayns ynnyd elley ta Noo Paul scrieu er yn aght shoh: “Ta Jee er yeih seose oollley fo mee-chredjue, dy voddagh eh myghin y hoilshaghey er ooilley.” (Rom. xi. 32.) ",,,4
"The Scripture shutteth up all under sin, that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ should be given unto them that believe.","“Ta’n Scriptyr er ghoaill stiagh ooilley fo peccah, dy voddagh y ghialdyn liorish credjue ayns[13] Yeesey Creest ve er ny choyrt dauesyn ta credjal.” (Gal. iii. 22.)","“Ta’n Scriptyr er ghoaill stiagh ooilley fo peccah, dy voddagh y ghialdyn liorish [13] Yeesey Creest ve er ny choyrt dauesyn ta credjal.” (Gal. iii. 22.)",[13] credjue ayns] omitted from the quotation.,4
"St. Paul in many places painteth us out in our colours, calling us the children of the wrath of God, when we be born; saying also, that we cannot think a good thought of ourselves, much less can we say well, or do well of ourselves.","Ta Noo Paul, ayns ymmodee ynnydyn, soiaghey shin magh chiart myr ta shin, genmys shin, “nyn gloan dy yymmoose,” tra va shin er nyn ruggey: (Eph. ii. 3): gra myrgeddin, “nagh vel shin fondagh j’in hene dy smooinaghtyn nhee erbee myr j’in hene;”[14] foddey sloo oddys mayd loayrt mie, ny jannoo mie, jin hene.",,"[14] Where the English paraphrases, the Manx quotes from 2 Cor. iii. 5.",4
"And the Wise Man saith in the Book of Proverbs, The just man falleth seven times a day.","As ta’n dooinney ereeney gra, ayns ny Raaghyn Creeney, “Ta’n dooinney cairagh tuittym shiaght keayrtyn ’sy laa.”[15] (xxiv. 16.)",,"[15] ’sy laa] This phrase is in the Homily, but not in the Proverbs passage referred to.",4
The most tried and approved man Job feared all his works.,"Ta Job, va wheesh er ny phrowal, as wheesh soit jeh, agglagh mychione ooilley e obbraghyn.",,,4
"St. John the Baptist, being sanctified in his mother’s womb, and praised before he was born, being called an angel, and great before the Lord; filled even from his birth with the Holy Ghost; the preparer of the way for our Saviour Christ; and commended of our Saviour Christ to be more than a prophet, and the greatest that ever was born of a woman; yet he plainly granteth that he had need to be washed of Christ: he worthily extolleth and glorifieth his Lord and Master Christ; and humbleth himself as unworthy to unbuckle his shoes; and giveth all honour and glory to God.","Ta Ean Bashtey, v’er “ny lhieeney lesh y Spyrryd Noo, veih eer brein e vayrey,” (Luke i. 15), as er ny voylley roish v’eh ruggit, enmyssit ny Ainle, as ooasle ayns shilley yn Chiarn, yn fer va dy yannoo aarloo raad nyn Saualtagh Creest, as er ny voylley liorishyn dy ve ny smoo na Phadeyr, as yn fer ’sooasle rieau va er ny ruggey jeh ben (Luke vii. 28), ny-yeih t’eh dy foshlit goaill-rish dy row feme echey dy v’er ny niee liorish Creest: t’eh dy cooie moylley as gloyraghey e Hiarn as e Vainshter Creest, as ginjillaghey eh-hene myr neu-feeu dy eaysley kianley e vraagyn, as coyrt dy chooilley ooashley as gloyr da Jee.

"So doth St. Paul both oft and evidently confess himself, what he was of himself; ever giving, as a most faithful servant, all praise to his Master and Saviour. So doth blessed St. John the Evangelist, in the name of himself, and of all other holy men –be they never so just– make this open confession ","Myr shoh ta Noo Paul, dy mennic as dy foshlit, goaill-rish c’red v’eh jeh hene: dy kinjagh coyrt myr sharvaant firrinagh, dy chooilley voylley gys e Vainshter as e Haualtagh.

": If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us: if we acknowledge our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.","My ta shin goaill-rish nyn beccaghyn, t’eshyn firrinagh as cairagh dy leih dooin nyn beccaghyn as dy ghlenney shin veih dy chooilley neu-ynrickys.

"Wherefore the Wise Man, in the book called Ecclesiastes, maketh this true and general confession, There is not one just man upon the earth that doth good, and sinneth not.","Shen-y-fa ta’n dooinney creeney, ayns y lioar enmyssit Ecclesiastes, fockley magh yn goaill-rish firrinagh as cadjin shoh: “Cha vel dooinney cairal er yn ooir ta jannoo mie, as nagh vel jannoo peccah:” (vii. 20.)",,,5
"And David is ashamed of his sin, but not to confess his sin. How oft, how earnestly, and lamentably doth he desire God’s great mercy for his great offences, and that God should not enter into judgment with him!","As ta David neayragh jeh e pheccah agh cha vel eh neayragh dy ghoaill-rish e pheccah.

"And again, how well weigheth this holy man his sins, when he confesseth that they be so many in number, and so hid, and hard to understand, that it is in manner impossible to know, utter, or number them.","As reesht, cre cha kiart as ta’n dooinney crauee shoh towse e pheccaghyn tra t’eh goaill-rish, dy vel ad wheesh ayns earroo, as cha follit, as cha dooillee dy v’er nyn doiggal, dy vel ad faggys erskyn roshtyn tushtey, goan, ny earroo!",,,5
"Wherefore, he having a true, earnest, and deep contemplation and consideration of his sins, and yet not coming to the bottom of them, he maketh supplication to God to forgive him his privy, secret, hid sins: the knowledge of the which he cannot attain unto.","Shen-y-fa, myr va ennaghtyn firrinagh, jeean, as dowin echey jeh e pheccaghyn, ga nagh row slane toiggal echey jeu, t’eh guee gys Jee dy leih da e pheccaghyn follit, nagh voddagh eh ronsaghey magh.

"He weigheth rightly his sins from the original root and spring-head; perceiving inclinations, provocations, stirrings, stingings, buds, branches, dregs, infections, tastes, feelings, and scents of them to continue in him still.

"Wherefore he saith, Mark and behold, I was conceived in sins: he saith not sin, but in the plural number, sins, forasmuch as out of one, as fountain, springeth all the rest.","Shen-y-fa t’eh gra, “Cur-my-ner, va mee er my chummey ayns olkys, as ayns peccah ren my voir m’y yiennaghtyn.” (Ps. li. 5.)[16]",,"[16] Because the Manx version of the Psalm has ‘sin’ not ‘sins’, the Manx text here enlarges the quotation, and omits the comment explicating the plural..",6
"Our Saviour Christ saith, There is none good but God; and that we can do nothing that is good without him; nor can any man come to the Father but by him.","Ta nyn Saualtagh Creest gra, “Cha vel ayn ny ta mie agh unnane, ynrican Jee”: (Mark x. 18; Luke xviii. 19): as nagh vod mayd veg ny ta mie y yannoo negooish, chamoo oddys “fer erbee cheet gys yn Ayr agh liorishyn.” (Ean xv.[17] 5.)","Ta nyn Saualtagh Creest gra, “Cha vel ayn ny ta mie agh unnane, ynrican Jee”: (Mark x. 18; Luke xvii. 19): as nagh vod mayd veg ny ta mie y yannoo negooish, chamoo oddys “fer erbee cheet gys yn Ayr agh liorishyn.” (Ean xv.[17] 5.)",[17] xv.] text xvi.,6

The /u/ implied by this spelling would be historical, Ir. tuill (dil.ie/18463).",6
