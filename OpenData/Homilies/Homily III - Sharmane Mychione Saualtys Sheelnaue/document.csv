"Because all men be sinners and offenders against God, and breakers of his Law and Commandments, therefore can no man, by his own acts, works, and deeds, seem they never so good, be justified and made righteous before God: but every man, of necessity, is constrained to seek for another righteousness of justification, to be received at God’s own hands; that is to say, the forgiveness of his sins and trespasses, in such things as he hath offended.[2]","Er-yn-oyr dy vel ooilley sheelnaue er chur-rish peccah noi Jee, as er vrishey e leigh as e annaghyn; shen-y-fa cha vod dooinney erbee, liorish e yannoo hene, e ghoan, as e obbraghyn, cre-erbee cha casherick as t’ad ayns fakin, v’er ny heyrey as jeant ynric fenish Jee: agh ta dy chooilley ghooinney eginit dy hirrey ynrickys elley, liorish oddys eh v’er ny heyrey, as soiagh ve jeant jeh liorish Jee; ta shen dy ghra, dy vod eh leih e peccaghyn y gheddyn.",,[2] in such things as he hath offended] omitted in the translation.,1
"And this justification, or righteousness, which we so receive of God’s mercy and Christ’s merits, embraced by faith, is taken, accepted, and allowed of God for our perfect and full justification.","Ta’n ynrickys shoh ta shin gheddyn veih myghin Yee as toilchinys Chreest, er ny gheddyn liorish credjue, soit jeh ayns shilley Yee son nyn slane seyrey.",,,1
"For the more full understanding hereof, it is our parts and duty ever to remember the great mercy of God; how that all the world being wrapped in sin by breaking of the Law, God sent his only Son our Saviour Christ into this world, to fulfil the Law for us; and, by shedding of his most precious blood, to make a sacrifice and satisfaction, or, as it may be called, amends to his Father, for our sins; to assuage his wrath and indignation conceived against us for the same.

"And they which in act or deed do sin after their baptism, when they turn again to God unfeignedly, they are likewise washed by this sacrifice from their sins, in such sort, that there remaineth not any spot of sin, that shall be imputed to their damnation.","As adsyn ta ayns jannoo cur rish peccah lurg nyn mashtey, tra t’ad chyndaa reesht gys Jee lesh arrys firrinagh, t’adsyn myrgeddin er nyn niee veih nyn beccaghyn liorish yn oural shoh: myr shen cha vel veg y pheccah faagit, vees er ny choyrt gys y lieh oc dy gheyrey ad.",,,2
"This is that justification, or righteousness, which St. Paul speaketh of, when he saith, No man is justified by the works of the Law, but freely by faith in Jesus Christ.","Shoh yn ynrickys shen ta Noo Paul loayrt jeh, tra t’eh gra, “Cha vel dooinney erbee er ny heyrey liorish obbraghyn y Leigh, agh dy nastee liorish credjue ayns Creest Yeesey.”",,,2
"And again he saith, We believe in Jesus Christ, that we be justified freely by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law; because that no man shall be justified by the works of the Law. Gal. ii.","As reesht t’eh gra, “Ta shin credjal ayns Yeesey Creest, dy vod shin v’er ny heyrey liorish credjue Chreest, as cha nee liorish obbraghyn y Leigh; son liorish obbraghyn y Leigh cha bee dooinney bio er ny heyrey.” (Gal. ii. 16.)",,,2

"If a ransom be paid for our redemption, then it is not given us freely. For a prisoner that payeth his ransom is not let go freely; for if he go freely, then he goeth without ransom: for what is it else to go freely than to be set at liberty without payment of ransom? ","My ta price eeckit son nyn gionnaghey-reesht, eisht cha vel eh er ny choyrt dooin dy nastee.

Answer.,,,,3
"This reason is satisfied by the great wisdom of God in this mystery of our redemption; who hath so tempered his justice and mercy together, that he would neither by his justice condemn us unto the everlasting captivity of the devil, and his prison of hell, remediless for ever without mercy; nor by his mercy deliver us clearly, without justice, or payment of a just ransom; but with his endless mercy he joined his most upright and equal justice.","Ta ansoor er ny choyrt da’n resooney shoh liorish ard chreenaght Yee ayns y folliaght shoh jeh nyn gionnaghey reesht; ta er sniemmey cairys as myghin cooidjagh er lheid yn aght, nagh jinnagh eh liorish e chairys deyrey shin gys cappeeys dy bragh farraghtyn y drogh-spyrryd, as pryssoon niurin, veih nagh vel feaysley trooid ny earishyn bra; chamoo liorish e vyghin chur dooin livrey-ys fegooish lhiassaghey ve jeant gys e chairys: agh ren eh sniemmey cooidjagh e vyghin feoilt as e chairys corrym-kiart.",,,3
"His great mercy he shewed unto us in delivering us from our former captivity, without requiring of any ransom to be paid, or amends to be made upon our parts; which thing by us had been impossible to be done.","E vyghin wooar ren eh soilshaghey dooin ayns feaysley shin veih nyn gappeeys, fegooish shirrey veg dy ve eeckit, ny lhiassaghey erbee dy ve jeant, er yn ayrn ain; red nagh voddagh ve jeant liorin hene.",,,3
"And, whereas, it lay not in us that to do, he provided a ransom for us; that was, the most precious body and blood of his own most dear and best beloved Son Jesus Christ; who besides this ransom, fulfilled the Law for us perfectly.","As myr nagh row niart ain shen y chooilleeney, chair[4] eshyn lhiassaghey er nyn son; ta shen, corp as fuill smoo ooasle e Vac graihagh Yeesey Creest: ren, marish y lhiassaghey shoh yn Leigh y chooilleeney dy firrinagh ayns yn ynnyd ain.",,[4] chair] i.e. chiare,3
"And so the justice of God and his mercy did embrace together, and fulfilled the mystery of our redemption.","As myr shoh ren cairys as myghin Yee coyrt qualtys dy cheilley,[5] as folliaght nyn gionnaghey reesht y chooilleeney.",,[5] Allusion to Ps. 85.10: Ta myghin as firrinys er choyrt qualtys d’y cheilley. ,3
"And of this justice and mercy of God, knit together, speaketh St. Paul in the third chapter to the Romans; Rom. iii.","As jeh yn cairys as myghin shoh dy Yee sniemmit cooidjagh, ta Noo Paul loayrt ayns y trass chabdyl gys ny Romanee: (23–25):",,,3
"All have offended and have need of the glory of God, but are justified freely by his grace, by redemption which is in Jesus Christ; whom God hath set forth to us for a reconciler and peace-maker through faith in his blood, to show his righteousness.","“Son ta ooilley er n’yannoo peccah, as er jeet giare jeh gloyr Yee; dy nastee jeant seyr liorish e ghrayse, trooid [y] livrey-ys ta ayns Yeesey Creest; eh ta Jee er chiarail dy ve ny lhiassaghey, trooid credjue ayns e uill, dy hoilshaghey magh e chairys.”","“Son ta ooilley er n’yannoo peccah, as er jeet giare jeh gloyr Yee; dy nastee jeant seyr liorish e ghrayse, trooid livrey-ys ta ayns Yeesey Creest; eh ta Jee er chairail dy ve ny lhiassaghey, trooid credjue ayns e uill, dy hoilshaghey magh e chairys.”",,4
"And in the tenth chapter; Rom. x. Christ is the end of the Law unto righteousness, to every man that believeth.",As ayns y jeihoo chabdyl: (4): “Ta Creest jerrey yn Leigh son cairys da dy chooilley unnane ta credjal.”,,,4
"And in the eighth chapter; Rom. viii. That which was impossible by the Law, inasmuch as it was weak by the flesh, God sending his own Son in the similitude of sinful flesh, by sin condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.","As ayns y hoghtoo chabdyl: (3, 4): “Shen nagh voddagh y Leigh y yannoo, trooid annooinid ny foalley, ren Jee liorish coyrt e Vac hene ayns caslys feill peccoil, as son peccah, peccah y gheyrey ayns yn eill, dy voddagh cairys y Leigh v’er ny chooilleeney aynin, nagh vel gimmeeaght lurg yn eill, agh lurg y Spyrryd.”",,,4
Three things must go together in our justification.,Shegin da tree reddyn goll cooidjagh dy heyrey shin.,,,4
"In these foresaid places, the Apostle toucheth specially three things, which must go together in our justification.","Ayns ny ynnydyn roïe enmyssit, ta’n Ostyl loayrt er-lheh jeh tree reddyn, shegin goll cooidjagh dy heyrey shin.",,,4
"Upon God’s part, his great mercy and grace: upon Christ’s part, justice: that is, the satisfaction of God’s justice, or the price of our redemption, by the offering of his body, and shedding of his blood with fulfilling of the Law perfectly and thoroughly: and upon our part true and lively faith in the merits of Jesus Christ; which yet is not ours, but by God’s working in us.","Er ayrn Yee, e vyghin as e ghrayse; er ayrn Chreest, cairys, ta shen, lhiassaghey jeant da cairys Yee, ny yn price jeh nyn gionnaghey reesht liorish chebbal e chorp, as deayrtey e uill, marish cooilleeney yn Leigh dy slane as dy firrinagh; as er yn ayrn ain, credjue firrinagh as bioal ayns toilchinys Yeesey Creest; nagh vel ny-yeih yn obbyr ainyn, agh obbrit aynin liorish Jee:",,,4
"So that in our justification, there is not only God’s mercy and grace, but also his justice; which the Apostle calleth the justice of God; and it consisteth in paying our ransom and fulfilling of the Law. ","myr shen, ayns seyrey shin, cha vel ynrican myghin as grayse Yee er ny hoilshaghey, agh myrgeddin e chairys, shen ta’n Ostyl genmys “Cairys Yee:” as t’eh shassoo ayns jannoo lhiassaghey er nyn son, as ayns cooilleeney yn Leigh: ",,,4
"And so the grace of God doth not shut out the justice of God in our justification, but only shutteth out the justice of man; that is to say, the justice of our works, as to be merits of deserving our justification. And therefore St. Paul declareth here nothing, upon the behalf of man, concerning his justification; but only a true and lively faith; which nevertheless is the gift of God, and not man’s only work, without God.","as myr shoh cha vel grayse Yee giarey magh cairys Yee ayns seyrey shin, agh ynrican giarey magh cairys dooinney: ta shen dy ghra, cairys nyn obbraghyn hene, myr tooilloo saualtys.

"How it is to be understood, that faith justifieth without works.",Cre’n aght ta credjue seyrey fegooish obbraghyn.,,,5
"And yet, that faith doth not shut out repentance, hope, love, dread and the fear of God, to be joined with faith in every man that is justified; but it shutteth them out from the office of justifying.","Agh ny-yeih nagh[6] vel credjue giarey magh arrys, treishteil, graih, as aggle Yee, dy ve sniemmit gys credjue ayns dy chooilley ghooinney t’er ny heyrey; agh t’eh giarey ad magh veih’n oik jeh seyrey shin.",,"[6] nagh vel] The translator reads ‘that’ as a complementizer, rather than the demonstrative intended —‘that faith’, i.e. ‘a true and lively faith , which is the gift of God.’",5
"So that, although they be all present together in him that is justified, yet they justify not all together.","Myr shen, ga dy vel [ad] ooilley ry-gheddyn aynsyn ta er ny heyrey; ny-yeih cha vel ad seyrey raad t’ad ooilley.","Myr shen, ga dy vel ooilley ry-gheddyn aynsyn ta er ny heyrey; ny-yeih cha vel ad seyrey raad t’ad ooilley.",,5
,,,,5
"Neither doth faith shut out the justice of our good works, necessarily to be done afterward of duty towards God —for we are most bounden to serve God, in doing good deeds commanded by him in his Holy Scripture, all the days of our life— but it excludeth them, so that we may not do them to this intent, to be made good by doing of them. For all the good works, that we can do, be imperfect; and therefore not able to deserve our justification: but our justification doth come freely, by the mere mercy of God; and of so great and free mercy, that, whereas all the world was not able of themselves to pay any part towards their ransom, it pleased our heavenly Father, of his infinite mercy, without any our desert or deserving, to prepare for us the most precious jewels of Christ’s body and blood; whereby our ransom might be fully paid, the Law fulfilled, and his justice fully satisfied.

"Also before was declared at large, that no man can be justified by his own good works; because that no man fulfilleth the Law according to the strict rigour of the Law.","Ve myrgeddin inshit roïe dy baghtal, nagh vod dooinney erbee v’er ny heyrey liorish e obbraghyn mie hene; [son] nagh vel dooinney erbee cooilleeney yn Leigh cordail rish bree kiart yn Leigh.","Ve myrgeddin inshit roïe dy baghtal, nagh vod dooinney erbee v’er ny heyrey liorish e obbraghyn mie hene; nagh vel dooinney erbee cooilleeney yn Leigh cordail rish bree kiart yn Leigh.",,6
"And St. Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians, proveth the same, Gal. ii. saying thus; If there had been any law given, which could have justified, verily righteousness should have been by the Law.","As ta Noo Paul, ayns yn[8] Screeuyn echey gys ny Galatianee, prowal yn chooid cheddin, (cab. iii. 21), gra myr shoh: “Dy beagh leigh er ve er ny livrey, oddagh bea y choyrt, lhisagh cairys dy firrinagh er ny ve liorish y leigh.”","As ta Noo Paul, ayns ny Screeuyn echey gys ny Galatianee, prowal yn chooid cheddin, (cab. iii. 21), gra myr shoh: “Dy beagh leigh er ve er ny livrey, oddagh bea y choyrt, lhisagh cairys dy firrinagh er ny ve liorish y leigh.”",,6
"And again he saith; If righteousness be by the Law, then Christ died in vain. Ephes. ii.","As reesht t’eh gra: “My ta seyrsnys cheet liorish y leigh, eisht ta Creest marroo ayns fardail.” (cab. ii. 21).",,,7

"And furthermore, he writeth to the Ephesians on this wise; By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God; and not of works, lest any man should glory.","As ny sodjey t’eh scrieu gys ny Ephesianee er yn aght shoh: (cab. ii. 8, 9): “Liorish grayse ta shiu er nyn sauail, trooid credjue: as shen cha nee jiu hene; she gioot Yee eh; cha nee liorish obbraghyn, nagh jinnagh dooinney erbee boggyssagh.”",,,7
