"Of all things that be good to be taught unto Christian people, there is nothing more necessary to be spoken of, and daily called upon, than charity: as well for that all manner of works of righteousness be contained in it; as also that the decay thereof is the ruin or fall of the world, the banishment of virtue, and the cause of all vice.","Jeh dy chooilley nhee ta vondeishagh da pobble Creestee dy ynsaghey, cha vel nhee erbee ta ny s’ymmyrchee dy ve loayrit jeh, as gagh-laa soit magh, na Graih: cha nee ynrycan dy vel dy chooilley cheint dy obbraghyn dy chairys goit stiagh ayn; agh myrgeddin dy vel y laccal echey coyrt naardey yn seihll, geiyrt ersooyll craueeaght as coyrt dy chooilley pheccah er y hoshiaght.","Jhe dy chooilley nhee ta vondeishagh da pobble Creestee dy ynsaghey, cha vel nhee erbee ta ny s’ymmyrchee dy ve loayrit jeh, as gagh-laa soit magh, na Graih: cha nee ynrycan dy vel dy chooilley cheint dy obbraghyn dy chairys goit stiagh ayn; agh myrgeddin dy vel y laccal echey coyrt naardey yn seihll, geiyrt ersooyll craueeaght as coyrt dy chooilley pheccah er y hoshiaght.",,,1
"And forsomuch as almost every man maketh and frameth to himself charity after his own appetite; and how detestable soever his life be both unto God and man, yet he persuadeth himself still that he hath charity: therefore you shall hear now a true and plain description or setting forth of charity, not of men’s imagination, but of the very words and example of our Saviour Jesus Christ.","As fakin dy vel faggys dy chooilley ghooinney jannoo dooghys ghiastyllys lurg e aigney hene, as cre erbee cha feohdoil as ta e ymmyrkey bea chammah gys Jee as dooinney, ny-yeih t’eh foast smooinaghtyn dy vel ghiastyllys echey; shen-y-fa nee shiu nish clashtyn coontey firrinagh as cronnal jeh graih, cha nee cordail rish smooinaghtyn fardailagh deiney, agh cordail rish eer goan as sampleyr nyn saualtagh Yeesey Creest.",,,,1

"Charity is, to love God with all our heart, all our life,[3] and all our powers and strength. With all our heart; that is to say, that our heart, mind, and study be set to believe his word, to trust in him, and to love him above all other things that we love best in heaven or in earth.","Ta graih firrinagh, dy choyrt graih da Jee lesh ooilley nyn gree, lesh ooilley nyn mea, as ooilley nyn niart.

"With all our life; that is to say, that our chief joy and delight be set upon him and his honour; and our whole life given unto the service of him above all things, with him to live and die, and to forsake all other things rather than him: for he that loveth his father or mother, son or daughter, house or land, more than me, saith Christ, is not worthy to have me.

"This is the first and principal part of charity; but it is not the whole: for charity is also to love every man, good and evil, friend and foe; and whatsoever cause be given to the contrary, yet nevertheless to bear good will and heart unto every man: to use ourselves well unto them, as well in words and countenance, as in all our outward acts and deeds: for so Christ himself taught, and so also he performed in deed.","Ta shoh yn chied as yn ard ayrn jeh ghiastyllys; agh cha vel eh yn slane, son ta Ghiastyllys myrgeddin dy choyrt graih da dy chooilley ghooinney, mie as sie, carrey as noid, as cre erbee yn oyr t’er ny choyrt son dwoaie, dy hoilshaghey aigney mie as kenjallys, da dy chooilley ghooinney, dy ymmyrkey shin hene dooie daue, chammah ayns ooilley nyn ghoan, as ayns ooilley nyn yannoo; son myr shen dynsee Creest, as myr shen myrgeddin ren eh eh hene y ymmyrkey.","Ta shoh yn chied as yn ard ayrn jeh ghiastyllys; agh cha vel eh yn slane, son ta Ghiastyllys myrgeddin dy choyrt graih da dy chooilley ghoinney, mie as sie, carrey as noid, as cre erbee yn oyr t’er ny choyrt son dwoaie, dy hoilshaghey aigney mie as kenjallys, da dy chooilley ghooinney, dy ymmyrkey shin hene dooie daue, chammah ayns ooilley nyn ghoan, as ayns ooilley nyn yannoo; son myr shen dynsee Creest, as myr shen myrgeddin ren eh eh hene y ymmyrkey.",,,3

"And of the love that we ought to have among ourselves each to other, he teacheth us thus: You have heard it taught in times past, Thou shalt love thy friend, and hate thy foe: but I tell you, Love your enemies; speak well of them that defame and speak evil of you; do well to them that hate you; pray for them that vex and persecute you; that you may be the children of your Father that is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise both upon the evil and good, and sendeth rain to just and unjust. For if you love them that love you, what reward shall you have? Do not the Publicans likewise?

"And if you speak well only of them that be your brethren and dear beloved friends, what great matter is that? Do not the Heathen the same also? These be the very words of our Saviour Christ himself, touching the love of our neighbour. And forasmuch as the Pharisees, with their most pestilent traditions and false interpretations and glosses, had corrupted and almost clearly stopped up this pure well of God’s lively word; teaching that this love and charity pertained only to a man’s friends, and that it was sufficient for a man to love them which do love him, and to hate his foes: therefore Christ opened this well again; purged it and scowered it by giving unto his godly law of charity a true and clear interpretation, which is this; that we ought to love every man, both friend and foe: adding thereto what commodity we shall have thereby, and what incommodity by doing the contrary.","Shoh goan nyn Saualtagh hene mychione graih er nyn Naboo.

"What thing can we wish so good for us, as the eternal heavenly Father to reckon and take us for his children? And this shall we be sure of, saith Christ, if we love every man without exception. And if we do otherwise, saith he, we be no better than the Pharisees, Publicans, and Heathen: and shall have our reward with them; that is, to be shut out from the number of God’s chosen children, and from his everlasting inheritance in heaven.","Cre’d oddys mayd geearree ny s’vondeishee er nyn son na’n Ayr dy bragh farraghtyn dy ghoaill shin son e chloan hene?

"Nor refused he to die, to satisfy his Father’s will; saying, If it may be, let this cup of death pass from me; if not, thy will be done, and not mine.","Chamoo dob eh dy gheddyn baase dy chooilleeney aigney e Ayrey, gra, “My she dty aigney’s eh scugh yn cappan shoh voym, agh cha nee my aigney’s agh dty aigney’s dy row jeant.” (Mian xxvi. 39.)[6]",,,[6] Only the last clause here is an exact quotation of the evangelist.,5
"He loved not only his friends, but also his enemies; which in their hearts bore exceeding great hatred against him, and with their tongues spake all evil of him, and in their acts and deeds pursued him with all their might and power, even unto death:","Hug eh graih cha nee ynrycan da e chaarjyn, agh da e noidyn ren freayll dwoaie erskyn towse eulyssagh noi echeysyn ayns ny creeaghyn oc, as lesh nyn jengaghyn ren loayrt dy chooilley cheint dy olk jeh, as ayns nyn yannoo deiyr ad er lesh ooilley nyn niart eer gys baase:",,,,5

"When they gave him evil words, he gave none evil again; when they did strike him, he did not smite again; and when he suffered death, he did not slay them, nor threaten them, but prayed for them and did put all things to his Father’s will.","Tra v’eh oltooanit, cha doltooan eh reesht, tra ren ad eh y woalley, cha ren eh ad y woalley reesht; as tra hur eh baase cha ren eh ad y varroo ny baggyrt, agh ghow eh padjer er nyn son, as hug eh seose dy chooilley nhee gys aigney e Ayr.",,,,5
"And as a sheep that is led unto the shambles to be slain, and as a lamb that is shorn of his fleece, maketh no noise nor resistance; even so went he to his death without any repugnance, or opening of his mouth to say any evil.

"Thus have I set forth unto you what charity is, as well by the doctrine as by the example of Christ himself: whereby also every man may without error know himself, what state and condition he standeth in; whether he be in charity, and so the child of the Father in heaven, or not. For although almost every man persuadeth himself to be in charity, yet let him examine none other man but his own heart, his life and conversation; and he shall not be deceived, but truly discern and judge whether he be in perfect charity or not.","Myr shoh ta mee er hoiaghey reue, cre ta graih, chammah liorish ynsagh as sampleyr Creest hene, liorish myrgeddin foddee dy chooilley ghooinney fegooish marranys gheddyn tushtey firrinagh jeh hene as jeh e stayd, eddyr eh ve ayns ghiastyllys, as myr shen lhiannoo jeh’n Ayr t’ayns Niau ny mannagh vel.

"But the burden should be easy enough, if, on the other side, every man would consider, what displeasure he hath done to his enemy again, and what pleasure he hath received of his enemy. ","Agh veagh yn errey eddrym dy liooar, my yinnagh dy chooilley ghooinney er y laue elley, cur tastey cre’n corree t’eh hene er choyrt er e noid reesht; as cre’n vondeish t’eh er gheddyn veih e noid.",,,,8
"And if we find no equal or even recompence, neither in receiving pleasures of our enemy, nor in requiting displeasures unto him again; then let us ponder the displeasures which we have done against Almighty God; how often and how grievously we have offended him: whereof if we will have of God forgiveness, there is none other remedy but to forgive the offences done unto us; which be very small in comparison of our offences done against God.","As mannagh vel shin feddyn cooilleen corrym, eddyr ayns ny vondeishyn ta shin geddyn veih nyn noid, ny ayns coyrt corree er neesht; eisht lhig dooin smooiniaghtyn er ny loghtyn ta shin er n’yannoo noi Jee Ooilley-niartal; cre cha mennic as cre cha trome as ta shin er choyrt corree er; jeh my ta shin geearree leih y gheddyn veih laue Yee, cha vel saase arragh agh dy leih dauesyn t’er n’yannoo aggair dooinyn; as ta shen feer veg ayns co-soylaghey jeh nyn loghtyn noi Jee.",,,,8
And if we consider that he which hath offended us deserveth not to be forgiven of us; let us consider again that we much less deserve to be forgiven of God.,"As my ta shin smooinaghtyn nagh vel eshyn t’er n’yannoo aggair dooin toilliu dy v’er ny leih liorin, lhig dooin smooinaghtyn reesht, dy vel shin toilliu foddey sloo dy v’er nyn leih liorish Jee.","As my ta shin smooinaghtyn nagh vel eshyn t’er n’yannoo aggair dooin toilliu dy ver ny leih liorin, lhig dooin smooinaghtyn reesht, dy vel shin toilliu foddey sloo dy v’er nyn leih liorish Jee.",,,8
"And although our enemy deserve not to be forgiven for his own sake, yet we ought to forgive him for God’s love; considering how great and many benefits we have received of him without our deserts; and that Christ hath deserved of us, that for his sake we should forgive them their trespasses committed against us.

"Hereunto is a plain and a brief answer; That plagues and punishments be not evil of themselves, if they be well taken of the harmless: and to an evil man they are both good and necessary; and may be executed according to charity, and with charity should be executed.

"For declaration whereof, you shall understand that charity hath two offices; the one contrary to the other, and yet both necessary to be used upon men of contrary sort and disposition.

"The one office of charity is, to cherish good and harmless men; not to oppress them with false accusations; but to encourage them with rewards to do well, and to continue in well doing; defending them with the sword from their adversaries.","Ta’n derrey oik dy ghraih, dy ooraghey deiney crauee as gyn loght; gyn dy yannoo tranlaase orroo liorish plaiyntyn aggairagh; agh dy ghreinnaghey ad liorish leaghyn dy yannoo mie, as dy hannaghtyn ayns jannoo mie; coadey ad liorish y chliwe veih nyn noidyn.","Ta’n derrey oik dy ghraih, dy ooraghey deiney crauee as gyn loght; gyn dy yannoo tranlaase orroo liorish plaiyntyn aggairagh; agh dy ghriennaghey ad liorish leaghyn dy yannoo mie, as dy hannaghtyn ayns jannoo mie; coadey ad liorish y chliwe veih nyn noidyn.",,,9
"And the office of bishops and pastors is, to praise good men for well doing, that they may continue therein;[10] and to rebuke and correct by the word of God the offences and crimes of all evil-disposed persons. For the other office of charity is, to rebuke, correct, and punish vice, without regard of persons; and is to be used against them only that be evil men, and malefactors or evil-doers.","As she oik Aspickyn as Saggyrtyn eh, dy voylley deiney crauee son jannoo mie, dy choyrt oghsan as dy smaghtaghey liorish Goo Yee loghtyn as peccaghyn dy chooilley unnane ta soit er olk.

"And that it is as well the office of charity to rebuke, punish, and correct them that be evil, as it is to cherish and reward them that be good and harmless, St. Paul declareth, writing to the Romans; saying, That the high powers are ordained of God, not to be dreadful to them that do well, but unto malefactors; to draw the sword to take vengeance of him that committeth the sin.","As dy vel eh oik graih chammah dy chur oghsan, dy smaghtaghey, as dy cherraghey ny mee-chrauee; as te dy choadey yn vooinjer ynric as oney, as dy choyrt leagh daue, ta’n Noo Paul fockley magh ayns e screeuyn gys ny Romanee, gra, “Dy vel ny pooaraghyn syrjey er nyn bointeil liorish Jee cha nee dy ve oyr aggle da obbraghyn mie, agh da drogh obbraghyn, dy hayrn y chliwe dy ghoaill cooilleen ersyn ta cur rish peccah.” (Rom. xiii. 1, 3, 4.)[11]",,,"[11] Only ‘oyr aggle da obbraghyn mie, aghda drogh obbraghyn’ is an exact quotation.",10

"So that both offices should be diligently executed, to fight against the kingdom of the devil; the Preacher with the word, and the Governor with the sword: else they love neither God nor them whom they govern; if, for lack of correction they wilfully suffer God to be offended, and them whom they govern to perish.","Myr shen dy lhisagh dagh oik v’er ny cooilleeney dy imneagh dy chaggey noi’n reeriaght dy ghorraghys; yn Preachoor lesh y goo, as yn Fer-reill lesh y chliwe; er aght elley cha vel graih oc er Jee ny orroosyn ta fo nyn reill; my t’ad jeh nyn yioin lhiggey da Jee v’er ny vrasnaghey liorish lhiggey shaghey dy ghoaill kerraghey, as yn vooinjer ta fo nyn reill dy herraghtyn.","Myr shen dy lhisagh dagh oik v’er ny cooilleeney dy imneagh dy chaggey noi’n reeriaght dy ghorraghys; yn Preachoor lesh y goo, as yn Fer-reill lesh y chliwe; er aght elley cha vel graih oc er Jee ny orroosyn ta fo nyn reill; my t’ad jeh nyn yioin lhiggey da Jee v’er ny vrasnaghey liorish lhiggey shaghey dy ghoaill kerraghey, as yn voinjer ta'd fo nyn reill dy herraghtyn.",,,10
"For as every loving father correcteth his natural son when he doth amiss, or else he loveth him not; so all governors of realms, countries, towns, and houses should lovingly correct them which be offenders under their governance, and cherish them which live innocently; if they have any respect either unto God and their office, or love unto them of whom they have governance.","Son myr ta dy chooilley Ayr graihagh smaghtaghey e vac dooghyssagh tra t’eh jannoo dy olk, er nonney cha vel eh graihagh er; myr shen lhisagh dy chooilley Chiannooyrt jeh reamyn, cheeraghyn, baljyn, as thieyn, dy graihagh smaghtaghey adsyn fo nyn relll ta cur-rish olk, as coadey adsyn ta baghey gyn loght, my ta sooill oc eddyr gys ooashley Yee ny gys nyn oik, ny graih orroosyn ta fo nyn gurrym.","Son myr ta dy chooilley Ayr graihagh smaghtaghey e Vac dooghyssagh tra t’eh jannoo dy olk, er nonney cha vel eh graihagh er; myr shen lhisagh dy chooilley Chiannooyrt jeh reamyn, cheeraghyn, baljyn, as thieyn, dy graihagh smaghtaghey adsyn fo nyn relll ta cur-rish olk, as coadey adsyn ta baghey gyn loght, my ta sooill oc eddyr gys ooashley Yee ny gys nyn oik, ny graih orroosyn ta fo nyn gurrym.",,,10
"And such rebukes and punishments of them that offend must be done in due time; lest by delay the offenders fall headlong into all manner of mischief; and not only be evil themselves, but also do hurt unto many men, drawing others, by their evil example, to sin and outrage after them; as one thief may both rob many men, and also make many thieves; and one seditious person may allure many, and annoy a whole town or country.","As shegin da ymmyd ve jeant ayns tra jeh lheid y kerraghey orroosyn ta jannoo olk, er aggle liorish lhiggey shaghey dy jean ny drogh yantee tuittym ayns dy chooilley cheint dy olk: as cha nee ynrycan ve peccoil ayns nyn ymmyrkey hene, agh myrgeddin jannoo skielley da ymmodee, tayrn feallagh elley, liorish nyn ghrogh hampleyr, dy chur rish peccah, myr oddys un vaarliagh chammah roostey ymmodee, as myrgeddin cur er ymmodee dy ve nyn roosteyryn; as foddee un traitoor tayrn ymmodee geiyrt er as boirey slane ard-valley ny cheer.","As shegin da ymmyd ve jeant ayns tra jeh lheid y kerraghey orroosyn ta jannoo olk, er aggle liorish lhiggey shaghey dy jean ny drogh yantee tuittym ayns dy chooilley cheint dy olk: as cha nee ynrycan ve pecoil ayns nyn ymmyrkey hene, agh myrgeddin jannoo skielley da ymmodee, tayrn feallagh elley, liorish nyn ghrogh hampleyr, dy chur rish peccah, myr oddys un vaarliagh chammah roostey ymmodee, as myrgeddin cur er ymmodee dy ve nyn roosteyryn; as foddee un traitoor tayrn ymmodee geiyrt er as boirey slane ard-valley ny cheer.",,,11
"And such evil persons that be so great offenders of God and the commonweal, charity requireth to be cut off from the body of the commonweal, lest they corrupt other good and honest persons; like as a good Surgeon cutteth away a rotten and festered member for love he hath to the whole body, lest it infect other members adjoining unto it.","As ta graih shirrey dy yiarey jeh lheid ny drogh yantee veih corp y theay as ta jannoo lheid ny ard-loghtyn noi Jee as y theay; er aggle dy jeannagh ad milley sleih cairagh: myr ta fer-lhee mie giarey jeh olt yngyragh er graih yn slane corp, er aggle dy jeannagh eh coyrt mow oltyn elley er gerrey da.",,,,11
"Thus it is declared unto you, what true charity or Christian love is, so plainly that no man need to be deceived: which love whosoever keepeth, not only towards God, whom he is bound to love above all things, but also toward his neighbour, as well friend as foe, it shall surely keep him from all offence of God, and just offence of man.","Myr shoh te inshit diu cre ta ghiastyllys firnnagh as graih Chreestee, cha baghtal nagh lhiass da dooinney erbee ve mollit: yn ghraih cheddin quoi erbee ta freayll chammah gys Jee, er t’eh kianlt dy ve graihagh erskyn dy chooilley nhee, agh myrgeddin gys e Naboo, eddyr y ve carrey ny noid; nee eh dy shickyr freayll eh veih kerraghey erbee veih Jee ny veih dooinney.","Myr shoh te inshet diu cre ta ghiastyllys firnnagh as graih Chreestee, cha baghtal nagh lhiass da dooinney erbee ve mollit: yn ghraih cheddin quoi erbee ta freayll chammah gys Jee, er t’eh kiault dy ve graihagh erskyn dy chooilley nhee, agh myrgeddin gys e Naboo, eddyr y ve carrey ny noid; nee eh dy shickyr freayll eh veih kerraghey erbee veih Jee ny veih dooinney.",,,11
"Therefore bear well away this one short lesson; that by true Christian charity, God ought to be loved, above all things; and all men ought to be loved, good and evil, friend and foe; and to all such we ought, as we may, to do good; those that be good, of love to encourage and cherish, because they be good; and those that be evil, of love to procure and seek their correction and due punishment, that they may thereby either be brought to goodness, or at the least, that God and the commonwealth may be the less hurt and offended.","Shen-y-fa cooinnee-jee er yn un lessoon giare shoh: Dy vel graih firrinagh as Creestee kianley shin dy ve graihagh er Jee erskyn dy chooilley nhee; as dy lhisagh graih v’er ny choyrt da dy chooilley ghooinney, mie as sie, carrey as noid; as da ooilley nyn lheid lhisagh shin mie y yannoo myr ta caa ain: yn vooinjer ta mie, veih graih daue er-yn-oyr dy vel ad mie, dy niartaghey as dy gherjaghey ad; as yn vooinjer ta olk, dy hirrey yn smaght as y kerraghey cooie oc veih graih daue, dy vod ad er yn aght shen eddyr v’er nyn dayrn gys craueeaght; ny ec y chooid sloo, dy vod aggair sloo ve jeant da Jee as y theay.",,,,12
