The knowledge of Holy Scripture is necessary.,Tushtey ny Scriptyryn Casherick ymmyrchagh.,,
"Unto a Christian man, there can be nothing either more necessary or profitable, than the knowledge of Holy Scripture; forasmuch as in it is contained God’s true word, setting forth his glory, and also man’s duty. ","     Cha vod nhee erbee ve ny s’ymmyrchee ny ny s’vondeishee da Creesteenyn, na tushtey jeh ny Scriptyryn Casherick: er-yn-oyr dy nee ayns shen ta Goo firrinagh Yee soiaghey magh yn gloyr echeysyn, as myrgeddin currym dooinney.

"And there is no truth nor doctrine, necessary for our justification and everlasting salvation, but that is, or may be, drawn out of that fountain and well of truth.","As cha vel firrinys ny ynsagh erbee ymmyrchagh gys nyn saualtys dy bragh farraghtyn, nagh vod ve er ny hayrn veih’n farrane shen dy irriney.",,
"Therefore, as many as be desirous to enter into the right and perfect way unto God, must apply their minds to know Holy Scripture; without the which, they can neither sufficiently know God and his will, neither their office and duty.","Shen-y-fa whilleen as ta aggindagh dy ghoaill toshiaght er y raad cairagh, as jeeragh gys Jee, shegin daue tastey y choyrt dy hoiggal ny Scriptyryn Casherick; n’egooish cha vod eddyr enney ve oc er Jee as e aigney, ny er nyn oik as nyn gurrym hene.",,

Who be the enemies to Holy Scripture.,Quoi ta noidyn da ny Scriptyryn Casherick.,,
"An apt similitude, declaring of whom the Scripture is abhorred.",,,
"And as drink is pleasant to them that be dry, and meat to them that be hungry; so is the reading, hearing, searching, and studying of Holy Scripture, to them that be desirous to know God, or themselves, and to do his will.

"And their stomachs only do loathe and abhor the heavenly knowledge and food of God’s Word, that be so drowned in worldly vanities, that they neither savour God, nor any godliness: for that is the cause why they desire such vanities, rather than the true knowledge of God.","as ta tushtey flaunyssagh as ooraghey jeh Goo Yee skeeagh as feohdoil dauesyn ny-lomarcan ta wheesh sluggit seose lesh fardaillyssyn seihltagh, nagh vel blass oc eddyr jeh Jee ny craueeaght: son shen yn oyr dy vel ad graihagh er lheld ny fardaillyssyn, as cha nee er tushtey firrinagh Yee.",,
"As they that are sick of an ague, whatsoever they eat and drink, though it be never so pleasant, yet it is as bitter to them as wormwood; not for the bitterness of the meat but for the corrupt and bitter humour that is in their own tongue and mouth; even so is the sweetness of God’s Word bitter, not of itself, but only unto them that have their minds corrupted with long custom of sin and love of this world.","Myr t’adsyn ta ching jeh ny crayne,[2] cre-erbee t’ad gee ny giu, ga dy beagh eh ass-towse millish ayn hene, ny-yeih te dausyn cha shiarroo as ullymar; cha nee veih sherriuid yn beaghey, agh veih’n vrold as sherriuid t’ayns nyn meeal hene; myr shoh ta miljid Goo Yee sharroo, cha nee ayn hene, agh ynrican dauesyn ta ny aignaghyn oc millit lesh cliaghtaghyn peccoil as graih yn theihll shoh.",,[2] ny crayne] Thomson: ‘= yn chreayn; perhaps perceived as pl.’

"Therefore, forsaking the corrupt judgment of fleshly men, which care not but for their carcase, let us reverently hear and read Holy Scripture, which is the food of the soul.

"Let us diligently search for the well of life in the books of the New and Old Testament, and not run to the stinking puddles of men’s traditions, devised by men’s imagination, for our justification and salvation.","lhig dooin dy tastagh shirrey chibber y vea ayns lioaryn y Chonaant Noa as y Chenn Chonaant, as gyn roie dy v’er nyn seyrey as er nyn sauail gys puill broghe oardaghyn deiney er ny geddyn magh liorish yn aigney oc hene.",,

"And as the great Clerk and godly Preacher, St. John Chrysostom, saith, whatsoever is required to the salvation of man, is fully contained in the Scripture of God. He that is ignorant, may there learn and have knowledge.","As, myr ta’n Chirveishagh tushtagh as Preachoor crauee Juan Chrysostom gra, Cre erbee ta ymmyrchagh gys saualtys dooinney te goit stiagh ayns Scriptyryn Yee:",,
"He that is hard-hearted, and an obstinate sinner, shall there find everlasting torments, prepared of God’s justice, to make him afraid, and to mollify, or soften him. He that is oppressed with misery in this world, shall there find relief in the promises of everlasting life, to his great consolation and comfort.","foddee eshyn ta mee-hushtagh, gynsaghey as geddyn tushtey ayns shen; nee yn drogh-yantagh roonagh feddyn ayns shen torchagh dy bragh farraghtyn cairyt liorish cairys Yee dy agglaghey eh, ny dy veenaghey eh; nee eshyn ta trome-laadit lesh seaghyn y vea shoh, feddyn kemmyrk ayns gialdynyn y vea dy bragh farraghtyn, gys e gerjagh mooar;",,

"If it shall require to teach any truth, or reprove false doctrine, to rebuke any vice, to commend any virtue, to give good counsel, to comfort, or exhort, or to do any other thing requisite for our salvation; all those things, saith St. Chrysostom, we may learn plentifully of the Scripture.","My vees eh ymmyrchagh dy ynsaghey firrinys erbee, ny dy gheyrey ynsagh erbee foalsey, dy chur oghsan da olk, dy voylley craueeaght, dy choyrt coyrle vie, dy gherjaghey, ny dy choyrlaghey, ny nhee erbee elley y yannoo ta ymmyrchagh gys nyn saualtys, —ooilley ny reddyn shoh foddee mayd gynsaghey veih ny Scriptyryn ayns slane towse.",,

"For the Scripture of God is the heavenly meat of our souls: the hearing and keeping of it maketh us blessed, sanctifieth us, and maketh us holy; it turneth our souls; it is a light lantern to our feet; it is a sure, stedfast, and everlasting instrument of salvation; it giveth wisdom to the humble and lowly hearts; it comforteth, maketh glad, cheereth, and cherisheth our conscience, it is a more excellent jewel, or treasure, than any gold or precious stone; it is more sweet than honey or honey-comb; Matt. iv. Luke xi. John xvii. Psalm xix.","Son ta Goo Yee beaghey flaunyssagh nyn anmeenyn: ta’n clashtyn as freayll eh jannoo shin maynrey, as casherickey shin; te chyndaa nyn anmeenyn; te londeyr sollys da nyn gassyn; te greï dy haualtys ta fondagh, shickyr, as dy bragh farraghtyn; te coyrt creenaght da ny creeaghyn imlee as injil; te gerjaghey, jannoo gennal, ooraghey, as niartaghey nyn gooinsheanse;. te berchys shiare na airh, ny clagh erbee costal; te ny s’miljey na mill as y chere-volley.

"it is called the best part, which Mary did choose; Luke x. for it hath in it everlasting comfort. The words of Holy Scripture be called words of everlasting life: John vi. for they be God’s instrument, ordained for the same purpose.","Te enmyssit ""yn ayrn shiare,"" ren Moirrey y reih (Luke x. 42) son te goaill stiagh gerjagh dy bragh farraghtyn.

"They are lively, quick, and mighty in operation, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and enter through, even unto the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, of the joints and the marrow. Coloss. i. Heb. iv."," “Ta Goo Yee bioal as breeoil, as ny s’geyrey na cliwe erbee dy ghaa foyr, roie trooid gys yn eer rhenn veih my-cheilley yn annym as y spyrryd, as ny juntyn as y smuirr.” (Heb. iv. 12)",,

"By this word of God we shall be judged: for the word that I speak, saith Christ, is it that shall judge in the last day. John xii.","Liorish yn Goo shoh dy Yee bee mayd er nyn mriwnys: son y Goo ta mish er loayrt (ta Creest gra,) nee shen y vriwnys ec y laa jerreynagh. (Ean xii. 48.)",,
"He that keepeth the word of Christ, is promised the love and favour of God, and that he shall be the dwelling-place or temple of the blessed Trinity. John xiv.","Dasyn ta freayll Goo Chreest ta gialdyn jeant jeh graih as foayr Yee, as dy bee eh ynnyd-vaghee as chiamble yn Trinnaid Bannit. (Ean xiv. 23–26.)",,
"This Word, whosoever is diligent to read, and in his heart to print that he readeth, the great affection to the transitory things of this world shall be minished in him, and the great desire of heavenly things, that be therein promised of God, shall increase in him.","Yn Goo shoh quoi-erbee ta tastagh dy lhaih, as dy hashtey seose ayns e chree shen ny t’eh lhaih, bee graih jeean da reddyn fardailagh y thelhll er ny choyrt naardey ayn, as nee yeearree jeean lurg reddyn flaunyssagh giallit ayns shen liorish Jee bishaghey ayn.",,
"And there is nothing that so much strengtheneth our faith and trust in God, that so much keepeth up innocency and pureness of the heart, and also of outward godly life and conversation, as continual reading and recording of God’s Word.","As cha vel nhee erbee ta wheesh niartaghey nyn gredjue as nyn dreishteil ayns Jee, ta wheesh cummal seose ônid as glennid cree, as myrgeddin ymmyrkey-bea crauee, as lhaih Goo Yee as smooinaghtyn er dy dowin:",,

"And in reading of God’s word, he not always most profiteth, that is most ready in turning of the book, or in saying of it without the book; but he that is most turned into it; that is most inspired with the Holy Ghost; most in his heart and life altered and changed into that thing which he readeth; he that is daily less and less proud, less wrathful, less covetous, and less desirous of worldly and vain pleasures; he that daily, forsaking his old vicious life, increaseth in virtue more and more.","     Ayns lhaih Goo Yee, cha vel eshyn dy kinjagh geddyn yn vondeish smoo, s’mennic ta chyndaa duillagyn y lioar, ny loayrt jeh veih cooinaghtyn, agh eshyn smoo ta gennaghtyn y phooar vreeoil echey er e chree, smoo fo leeileilys y Spyrryd Noo, as smoo er ny caghlaa cheu-sthie as cheu-mooie gys shen ny t’eh lhaih; eshyn ta gagh-laa ny s’imlee, ny s’meen, ny s’giastyllee, as ny ’seyre veih graih jeh eunyssyn seihltagh as fardailagh; eshyn ta gagh-laa coyrt cooyl rish e henn cliaghtaghyn peccoil, as goll er e hoshiaght ny smoo as ny smoo ayns craueeaght bea.",,
What incommodities the ignorance of God’s word bringeth.,,,

"For without a single eye, pure intent and good mind, nothing is allowed for good before God. And on the other side, nothing more darkeneth Christ and the glory of God, nor bringeth in more blindness and all kinds of vices, than doth the ignorance of God’s Word. Isa. v.
