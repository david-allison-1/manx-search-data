A SERMON AGAINST Swearing and Perjury,SHARMANE NOI GWEEAGHYN AS GOAILL LOO-OAIAGH.,,,,1
"Almighty God, to the intent his most holy name should be had in honour, and evermore be magnified of the people, commandeth that no man should take his name vainly in his mouth, threatening punishment unto him that unreverently abuseth it by swearing, forswearing, and blasphemy.","Ta Jee ooilley-niartal, dy vod yn ennym casherick echeysyn ve ny s’yrjey er ny ooashlaghey, as ve dy bragh er ny ghloyraghey liorish e phobble, er harey nagh jean persoon erbee goaill yn ennym echeysyn ayns aght fardailagh ayns e veeal; baggyrt lesh kerraghey eshyn ta jannoo ymmyd jeh ayns aght neu-arrymagh, liorish loo cadjin, loo-oaiagh, as gueeaghyn.",,,,1
"To the intent therefore that this commandment may be the better known and kept, it shall be declared unto you, both how it is lawful for Christian people to swear, and also what peril and danger it is vainly to swear, or to be forsworn. ","Er-chee er-y-fa shen, dy vod yn sarey shoh ve ny share er ny hoiggal as er ny reayll, bee eh er ny ockley magh diuish, chammah er cre ny oyryn te lowal da Creesteenyn dy loo, as myrgeddin cre’n dangeyr t’ayns loo cadjin as loo-oaiagh.","Erchee er-y-fa shen, dy vod yn sarey shoh ve ny share er ny hoiggal as er ny reayll, bee eh er ny ockley magh diuish, chammah er cre ny oyryn te lowal da Creesteenyn dy loo, as myrgeddin cre’n dangeyr t’ayns loo cadjin as loo-oaiagh.",,,1
How and in what causes it is lawful to swear.,,,,,1
"First, when judges require oaths of the people for declaration or opening of the truth, or for execution of justice, this manner of swearing is lawful.","Hoshiaght, tra ta Briwnyn geamagh er sleih dy loo cour fockley magh as soilshaghey yn irriney, dy vod cairys ve er ny yannoo, ta’n cheint shoh dy loo lowal.",,,,1
"Also when men make faithful promises, with calling to witness of the name of God, to keep covenants, honest promises, statutes, laws, and good customs, as Christian princes do in their conclusions of peace, for conservation of commonwealths; and private persons promise their fidelity in matrimony, or one to another in honesty and true friendship;","Myrgeddin tra ta deiney jannoo gialdynyn firrinagh liorish geamagh er Jee gys feanish dy reayll conaantyn, gialdynyn onneragh, leighyn, oardaghyn, as cliaghtaghyn mie, myr ta Reeaghyn Creestee jannoo tra t’ad jannoo shee, son sauchys reeriaghtyn: As persooynyn er-lheh coyrt nyn mreearrey yn derrey yeh da’n jeh elley ayns poosey, ny ayns cooish onneragh erbee elley, as ayns caarjys firrinagh, ","Myrgeddin tra ta deiney jannoo gialdynyn firrinagh liorish geamagh er Jee gys feanish dy reayll conaantyn, gialdynyn onneragh, leighyn, oardaghyn, as cliaghtaghyn mie, myr ta Reeaghyn Creestee jannoo tra t’ad jannoo shee, son sauchys reeriaghtyn: As persooynyn er-lheh coyrt nyn mreearey yn derrey yeh da’n jeh elley ayns poosey, ny ayns cooish onneragh erbee elley, as ayns caarjys firrinagh, ",,,2
"and all men when they do swear to keep common laws, and local statutes, and good customs, for due order to be had and continued among men; when subjects do swear to be true and faithful to their king and sovereign lord; and when judges, magistrates, and officers swear truly to execute their offices;","as dy chooilley ghooinney tra t’eh loo dy reayll leighyn as oardaghyn as cliaghtaghyn mie yn cheer t’eh baghey ayn, dy vod ad ve dy kinjagh er nyn reayll seose mastey deiney, tra ta’n theay loo dy ve firrinagh da nyn Ree; As tra ta Briwnyn as fir-oik loo dy firrinagh dy chooilleeney curmyn nyn oik,","as dy chooilley ghooinney tra t’eh loo dy reayll leighyn as oardaghyn as cliaghtaghyn mie yn cheer t’eh baghey ayn, dy vod ad ve dy kinjagh er nyn reayll seose mastey deiney, tra ta’n theay loo dy ve firrinagh da nyn Ree.

"and when a man would affirm the truth to the setting forth of God’s glory (for the salvation of the people) in open preaching of the Gospel, or in giving of good counsel privately for their souls’ health:","as tra ta deiney dy hickyraghey yn irriney cour soilshaghey magh gloyr Yee (son saualtys gheiney) ayns dy foshlit preacheil yn Sushtal, ny cur coyrle erbee son slaynt nyn anmeenyn:",,,,2

"But when men do swear of custom, in reasoning, buying, and selling, or other daily communications (as many be common and great swearers,) such kind of swearing is ungodly, unlawful, and forbidden by the commandment of God:","Agh tra ta deiney loo dy cadjin ayns pleadeil, ayns kionnaghey as creck, ny ayns ayrn erbee elley jeh nyn ymmyrkey gagh laa, (myr ta ymmodee looderyn cadjin as eajee) ta lheid y loo mee-chrauee, noi yn leigh, as mee-lowal liorish saraghyn Yee.","Agh tra ta deiney loo dy cadjin ayns pleadeil, ayns kionnaghey as creck, ny ayns ayrn erbee elley jeh nyn ymmyrkey gagh laa, (myr ta ymmodee looderyn cadjin as eajee) ta lheid y loo mee-chrauee, noi yn leih, as mee-lowal liorish saraghyn Yee.",,,2

"And here is to be noted, that lawful swearing is not forbidden, but commanded by Almighty God: for we have examples of Christ and godly men, in holy Scripture, that did swear themselves, and required oaths of others likewise; and God’s commandment is, Thou shalt dread thy Lord God, and shalt swear by his name. Deut. vi. And Almighty God by his Prophet David saith, All men shall be praised that swear by him. Psal. lxiii.","As ayns shoh lhisagh tastey ve goit nagh vel sarey erbee noi loo er oyryn cooie, agh er ny harey liorish Jee ooilley-niartal.

"Thus did our Saviour Christ swear divers times, saying, Verily, verily: John iii. and St. Paul sweareth thus, I call God to witness: 2 Cor. i. and Abraham, waxing old, required an oath of his servant, that he should procure a wife for his son Isaac, which should come out of his own kindred: and the servant did swear that he would perform his master’s will. Gen. xxiv.","Myr shoh ren nyn Saualtagh Creest loo caghlaaghyn keayrt gra, Dy firrinagh, firrinagh.

After this point the text of this homily does not use quotation marks for its paraphrased references (and only once, for an essentially exact quote, from Zechariah).",,3
"Abraham also, being required, did swear unto Abimelech the king of Geraris, that he should not hurt him, nor his posterity; and likewise did Abimelech swear unto Abraham. Gen. xxi..

"Also God once commanded, that if a thing were laid to pledge to any man, or left with him to keep, if the same thing were stolen, or lost, that the keeper thereof should be sworn before judges, that he did not convey it away, nor used any deceit in causing the same to be conveyed away, by his consent or knowledge.","Myrgeddin ren Jee cheayrt dy row sarey, my va red erbee er ny choyrt myr Gioal da dooinney erbee, ny faagit echey dy hashtey, my va’n red cheddin er ny gheid ny caillit, dy neign dasyn huggey v’er ny choyrt dy hashtey loo kiongoyrt rish Briwnyn nagh ghow eh eh ersooyll, as nagh ren eh molteyrys erbee ayns geddyn eh currit lesh ersooyll liorish persoon erbee elley, liorish e chied ny lesh e hushtey.

"And St. Paul saith, That in all matters of controversy between two persons, whereas one saith yea, and the other nay, so as no due proof can be had of the truth, the end of every such controversy must be an oath ministered by a judge. Heb. vi.","As ta’n Noo Paul gra, ayns dy chooilley streeu eddyr daa phersoon, tra ta’n derrey yeh gra she, as yn jeh elley cha nee, as nagh vel prowal erbee fondagh ry-gheddyn jeh’n irriney, dy chur jerrey er lheid y streeu dy negin da loo v’er ny ghoaill kiongoyrt rish Briw.

"And, moreover, God by the Prophet Jeremy saith, Thou shalt swear, the Lord liveth in truth, in judgment, in righteousness. Jer. iv.","As myrgeddin ta Jee liorish y Phadeyr Jeremiah gra, Nee oo loo myr ta’n Chiarn bio ayns firrinys, ayns briwnys as ynrickys.

"So that whosoever sweareth when he is required of a judge, let him be sure in his conscience that his oath have these three conditions, and he shall never need to be afraid of perjury.

What conditions an oath ought to have.,,,,,4
"First, he that sweareth must swear truly; that is, he must (setting apart all favour and affection to the parties) have the truth only before his eyes, and, for love thereof, say and speak that which he knoweth to be truth, and no further.","Hoshiaght, eshyn ta loo, shegin da loo dy firrinagh, ta shen (cur dy lhiattee dy chooilley foayr as aigney mie da’n derrey yeh ny da’n jeh elley jeusyn t’ec streeu) shegin da freayll yn irriney ynrycan kiongoyrt rish e hooillyn, as er graih yn ynrickys gra as loayrt shen ta fys echey dy ve yn irriney, as gyn veg smoo.","Hoshiaght, eshyn ta loo, shegin da loo dy firrinagh, ta shen (cur dy lhiattee dy chooilley foayr as aigney mie da’n derrey yeh ny da’n jeh elley jeusyn t’ec streu) shegin da freayll yn irriney ynrycan kiongoyrt rish e hooillyn, as er graih yn ynrickys gra as loayrt shen ta fys echey dy ve yn irriney, as gyn veg smoo.",,,4
The second.,,,,,4
"The second is, he that taketh an oath, must do it with judgment; not rashly and unadvisedly, but soberly, considering what an oath is.","’Sy nah ynnyd, eshyn ta goaill loo, shegin da jannoo eh lesh briwnys, cha nee dy daaney, as dy mee-choyrlagh, agh dy sheelt, smooinaghtyn dy dowin cre t’eh jannoo.",,,,4
The third,,,,,4
"The third is, he that sweareth, must swear in righteousness; that is, for the very zeal and love which he beareth to the defence of innocency, to the maintenance of the truth, and to the righteousness of the matter or cause: all profit, disprofit, all love and favour unto the person for friendship or kin","’Sy trass ynnyd, eshyn ta loo shegin da loo ayns ynrickys, ta shen son y ghraih jeean t’echey dy endeil onid, dy chummal seose yn irriney, as dy hoilshaghey cheu chairagh yn chooish; tilgey dy lhiattee dy chooilley smooinaghtyn jeh cosney ny coayl, dy chooilley ghraih as foayr gys yn derrey phersoon er graih mooinjerys ny caarjys.","’Sy trass ynnyd, eshyn ta loo shegin da loo ayns ynrickys, ta shen son y ghraih jeean t’echey dy endeil onid, dy chummal seose yn irriney, as dy hoilshaghey cheu chairagh yn chooish.

Why we be willed in Scripture to swear by the name of God,,,,,4
"Thus an oath (if it have with it these three conditions) is a part of God’s glory, which we are bound by his commandments to give unto him: for he willeth that we shall swear only by his name; not that he hath pleasure in our oaths; but like as he commanded the Jews to offer sacrifice unto him, not for any delight that he had in them, but to keep the Jews from committing of idolatry; so, he commanding us to swear by his holy name, doth not teach us that he delighteth in swearing, but he thereby forbiddeth all men to give his glory to any creature in heaven, earth, or water.","Myr shoh ta loo (my t’eh firrinagh ayns ny three ayrnyn shoh) ayrn jeh’n gloyr shen ta shin kianlt liorish saraghyn Yee dy eeck da.

Commodities had by lawful oaths made and observed,,,,,5
"Hitherto you see that oaths lawful are commanded of God, used of patriarchs and prophets, [Psalm xv.][7] of Christ himself, and of his Apostle Paul.","Liorish ny ta er ve rait, hee shiu dy vel Dy Loo ayns aght lowal er ny harey liorish Jee, er ny yannoo liorish ny shen ayryn as Phadeyryn [Ps. xv. 5], liorish Creest hene, as e Ostyl Paul.","Liorish ny ta er ve rait, hee shiu dy vel Dy Loo ayns aght lowal er ny harey liorish Jee, er ny yannoo liorish ny shen ayryn as Phadeyryn, liorish Creest hene, as e Ostyl Paul.",[7] This ref in 1817.,,5
Therefore Christian people must think lawful oaths both godly and necessary.,"Shen-y-fa shegin da dy chooilley Chreestee jeeaghyn er loo ayns aght cooie, dy ve crauee as ymmyrchagh.",,,,5

"By lawful oaths, which kings, princes, judges and magistrates do swear, common laws are kept inviolate, justice is indifferently ministered, harmless persons, fatherless children, widows and poor men, are defended from murderers, oppressors, and thieves, that they suffer no wrong, nor take any harm.","Liorish ny looghyn lowal ta Reeaghyn as Briwnyn as Fir-oik gurneil, ta leighyn y theay er ny reayll gyn brishey, ta Briwnys dy kiart er ny choyrt, ta persoonyn oney, cloan gyn Ayr, mraane treoghe, as deiney boghtey er nyn vendeil voish dunveryn, tranlaasee as maarlee, nagh jean ad surranse aggair ny geddyn assee.",,,,5

Vain swearing is forbidden.,,,,,5
"Wherefore, when Christ so earnestly forbad swearing, it may not be understood as though he did forbid all manner of oaths: but he forbiddeth all vain swearing and forswearing both by God, and by his creatures, as the common use of swearing in buying, selling, and in our daily communication, to the intent every Christian man’s word should be as well regarded in such matters, as if he should confirm his communication with an oath: for every Christian man’s word, saith St. Hierom, should be so true, that it should be regarded as an oath.","Shen-y-fa tra ta Creest mee-lowal loo ayns aght cha jeean, cha vod eh ve er ny hoiggal myr dy beagh eh mee-lowal dy chooilley cheint dy loo, agh t’eh mee-lowal loo ayns aght fardailagh, as loo-oaiagh liorish Jee, ny veg jeh e chretooryn, ta shen loo cadjin ayns nyn ghellalyn, as ayns nyn dhaggloo cadjin, er-chee dy vod fockle dy chooilley Chreestee ve er ny ghoaill er lheid ny oyryn unchooid as[8] dy beagh eh dy hickyraghey ny t’eh dy ghra liorish loo.
