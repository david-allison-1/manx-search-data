[c. 1820-23][1],1823,,"[1] Tract No. 174 is not yet in the Society’s catalogue of 1820, but it is in the 1824 catalogue. Since the Manx translation bears an 1823 date, the original must have come out that year or earlier.",1
THE VILLAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS.,BALLEY-BEG AYNS SLEITYN Y RAANK.,,,2
"M. ——, a merchant at the head of one of the first commercial houses in Paris, had lately occasion to visit the manufactories established in the mountainous tracts of the departments of the Loire and the Puy-de-Dôme.","Va oyr ec Marchan dy row, v’ayns unnane jeh ny thieyn s’yrjey son dellal ayns Paris, dy gholl dy akin Factoryeen v’er ny hroggal ayns ny Sleityn, ayns ayrn jeh’n Raank, enmyssit yn Loire.",,,2
"The road that conducted him back to Lyons traversed a country rich in natural productions, and glowing with all the charms of an advanced and promising Spring.","Myr v’eh goll er y raad, va’n aigney echey lhieent lesh boggey, ec yn shilley erskyn-towse aalin, va’n Cheer, ec yn imbagh shen, fordrail da.",,,2

"The nearer view was unusually diversified; not only by the fantastic forms of mountains, the uncertain course of small and tributary streams, and the varying hues of fields of pasture, corn, vines, and vegetables; but by the combinations and contrasts of nature and of art, and the occupations of rural and commercial industry. Factories and furnaces were seen rising amidst barns and sheep-cotes; peasants were digging and ploughs gliding amidst forges and founderies; verdant slopes and graceful clumps of trees were scattered amidst the black and ugly mouths of exhausted coal pits, and the gentle murmur of the stream was subdued by the loud rattle of the loom. Sometimes M.—— and his friend halted amidst all that is delightful and soothing; and, after a short advance found themselves amidst barrenness, deformity, and confusion. The remoter scenery was not less impressive. Behind them were the rugged mountains of Puy de Dôme; the lofty Tavare lifted its majestic head beside them, and far before appeared the brilliant summit of Mont Blanc. ",,,,2

"     In this state of mind he arrived at the skirts of a hamlet[4] placed on the declivity of a mountain; and being desirous of finding a shorter and more retired track, he stopped at a little house to inquire the way.","     Lesh yn cree echey soit er ny reddyn shoh, as e aigney lhieent lesh aalid y Cheer, hie yn Marchan er y hoshiaght marish e heshey-troailtagh, derrey haink eh dys balley-beg er lhiattee slieau; as myr veh aggindagh dy gheddyn raad s’girrey, hass eh ec thie dy vriaght son y raad.",,"[4] Other sources indicate that the hamlet is Saint-Jean Bonnefonds, now on the outskirts of Saint-Étienne. It was indeed known for its mines and ribbon-weaving in the 19th century.",2
"From the windows several females were watching the movements of a little child; and just as M.—— inquired for a road across the mountains, the infant was in danger of being crushed by a coal cart which had entered the street. The cries and alarms of the females were met by the activity of the travellers, and the companion of M.—— set off to snatch the infant from danger, and place him in security.","Myr ve’h ny hassoo, honnick eh shiartaanse dy vraane jeeaghyn magh veih ny uinnagyn er lhiannoo va roie mygeayrt as cloïe; Agh choud’s ve’h briaght jeu son y raad s’girrey va leeideil dys ny sleityn va’n lhiannoo ayns gaue dy ve gortyt lesh cart geill[5] va cheet ’sy traid.

"An elderly female from the second story gave M. ——, who was still on his horse, the directions he desired; and, at the same time, expressed her uneasiness that the gentleman should have had the trouble to seek the child.","Choud’s ve’h jannoo shoh, va’n Varchan[6] ynsit yn raad ve’h dy hirrey, liorish ben v’er roie dy mie ayns eash, va ny hoie ayns uinnag yn lout; as ec y traa cheddin, ghuee ee er dy ghoaill yn leshtal eck, son dy row e chomraag[7] er ny chumrail ayns shirrey yn lhiannoo.",,"[6] A few times in this text Marchan appears lenited for no apparent reason.
[7] chomraag] elsewhere, including once in this text, spelt c(h)umraag; error here?",2
"“Madam, (interrupted M.——,) my friend is only performing his duty: we ought to do to another as we would that another should do to us; and in this wretched world, we are bound to assist each other.","“Ven (dreggyr eshyn) cha vel my Charrey’s agh jannoo e churrym: lhisagh shinyn jannoo rish dy chooilley ghooinney myr baillhein ad y yannoo rooin: as, ayns y theihll seaghnagh shoh, ta shin ooilley kianlt dy chooney lesh y chielley.","“Ven (dreggyr eshyn) cha vel my Charrey’s agh jannoo e churrym: lhisagh shinyn jannoo rish dy chooilley ghoonney myr baillhein ad y yannoo rooin: as, ayns y theihll seaghnagh shoh, ta shin ooilley kianlt dy chooney lesh y chielley.",,3
"You are kind enough to direct us travellers in the right road, and surely the least we can do is to rescue your child from danger.","Tou uss er ve cha dooie dooinyn, ta er nyn yoarreeaght, as dy yeeaghyn dooin yn raad cair, as shickyr eisht te cha beg as oddys mayd yannoo dy choadey dty lhiannoo’s, tra te’h ayns gaue.",,,3
"The Holy Scriptures teach us these duties, and the Gospel presents us the example of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, when we were in ignorance and danger, came to our world to seek and to save that which was lost.” ","Ta ny scriptyryn Casherick gynsaghey dooin yn currym shoh, as ta’n Sushtal soilshaghey dooin sampleyr nyn Jiarn Yeesey Creest, haink dys y theihll, tra va shin ooilley ayns gaue as fo mee-hushtey, dy hirrey, as dy hauail shen ny va caillit.”",,,3
"“Ah! Sir, (replied the good woman,) you are very condescending, and what you say is very true; but your language surprises me: it is so many years since in this village we have heard such truths, and especially from the lips of a stranger.”","“Dy jarroo, Vainshter (dreggyr yn Ven) ta shiu feer imlee, as ta ny ta shiu dy ghra feer firrinagh; agh ta’n ghlare eu jannoo yindys dou: ta whilleen blein neayr’s cheayll shin lheid ny firrinyssyn er ny hoilshaghey ayns y Valley-beg shoh, as er-lheh voish meillyn dooinney ta ny yoarree.”",,,3
"“Madam, (resumed M.——,) we are all strangers here, and sojourners bound to eternity; there is but one road, one guide, one Saviour, who can conduct us safely; if we feel this, young or old, rich or poor, we are all one in Christ; and, however scattered on earth, shall all arrive at the heavenly city, to which he has gone to prepare mansions for us.”","“Ven (dreggyr yn Marchan reesht) ta shin ooilley nyn yoarreeyn ayns shoh, as troailtee er nyn yurnah dys beaynid: cha vel ayn agh un raad, [8]un leeideilagh, un Saualtagh, oddys shin y chur lesh ayns sauchys; as my ta shin gennaghtyn shoh, ga-reih dooin ve shenn ny aeg, boght ny berchagh, ta shin ooilley unnane ayns Creest; as cre theihll cha lhean as ta shin er nyn skeaylley er eaghtyr ny hooirrey, hig mayd ooilley ec y jerrey dys yn Ard-Valley flaunyssagh, raad ta nyn Saualtagh er n’gholl roin dy yannoo aarloo ynnydyn-vaghee er nyn son.”","“Ven (dreggyr yn Marchan reesht) ta shin ooilley nyn yoarreeyn ayns shoh, as troailtee er nyn yurnah dys beaynid: cha vel ayn agh un raad [8]un leeideilagh, un Saualtagh, oddys shin y chur lesh ayns sauchys; as my ta shin gennaghtyn shoh, ga-reih dooin ve shenn ny aeg, boght ny berchagh, ta shin ooilley unnane ayns Creest; as cre theihll cha lhean as ta shin er nyn skeaylley er eaghtyr ny hooirrey, hig mayd ooilley ec y jerrey dys yn Ard-Valley flaunyssagh, raad ta nyn Saualtagh er n’gholl roin dy yannoo aarloo ynnydyn-vaghee er nyn son.”","[8] Here the bottom right section of the printed page is torn off, and has been replaced with a handwritten copy, imitating print, in a style that appears 20th-century. (Greek-style <e> is noticeable). The ms. text is indicated here in bold.",3
"“These doctrines, Sir, (exclaimed the female) support the hearts of many of us, who have scarcely travelled beyond our own neighbourhood; and it is so rare and so delightful to hear them from others, that if it will not be an abuse of your Christian politeness, I would request you to alight and visit my humble apartment.”","“Ta’n ynsagh shoh, Vainshtyr (dreggyr y Ven) gerjaghey creeaghyn ymmodee jin, ta s’coan er hroailt ny sodjey na’n Naboonys ain; as te red cha gerjoilagh dy chlashtyn lheid ny goan veih meillyn feallagh elley, dy jinnin gearree jiu dy harlheim, mannagh vel mee goaill rouyr reamys, as dy heet stiagh ayns my hie.”","Ta’n ynsagh shoh, Vainshtyr (dreggyr y Ven) gerjaghey creeaghyn ymmodee jin, ta s’coan er hroailt ny sodjey na’n Naboonys ain; as te red cha gerjoilagh dy chlashtyn lheid ny goan veih meillyn feallagh elley, dy jinnin gearree jiu dy harlheim, mannagh vel mee goaill rouyr reamys, as dy heet stiagh ayns my hie.”",,3
"“I shall comply most cheerfully with your request, (replied M.——,) for though time is precious, I shall be thankful to spend a few minutes in these mountains among those with whom I hope to dwell for ever on Mount Zion.”","“Nee’m yn cheb ayd y ghoaill dy arryltagh (dooyrt yn dooinney seyr) son ga nagh vel monney tra ain dy chumrail foast bee’m booisal dy cheau tammylt beg dy hraa ayns ny sleityn shoh, ny mast ocsyn, maroo ta mee treishteil dy chummal son dy bragh er Cronk Zion.”","“Nee’m yn cheb ayd y ghoaill dy arryltagh (dooyrt yn dooinney seyr) son ga nagh vel monney tra ain dy chumrail foast bee’m booisal dy cheau tammylt beg dy hraa ayns y sleityn shoh, yn mast ocsyn, maroo ta mee treishteil dy chummal son dy bragh er Cronk Zion.”",,3
"My friend M.—— mounted to the second story, followed by his companion. He found the female with whom he had conversed, surrounded by her daughters and her grand-daughters, all busily employed in five looms, filled with galloons and ribbons, destined for the capital and the most distant cities of the world.","“Eisht harlheim y Dooinney seyr, as hie eh stiagh ’sy thie marish e chumraag, as seose er y lout, as hooar eh yn ven, v’eh er ve loayrt ree, ny hoie mastey ny inneenyn, as ny oe-yn eck, dy jeidjagh ec nyn obbyr.

"The good widow was between 60 and 70 years of age; her appearance was neat and clean; and all the arrangements of her apartment bespoke industry, frugality, and piety.","As ga dy dooar eh yn Ven, ve’h er ve loayrt ree, dy ve shenn ven-treoghe, eddyr three feed as three feed bleïn as jeih dy eash, ny-yeih v’ee jeaghyn feeudagh as glen: as va dy chooilley red ’sy thie eck soit magh ayns lheid yn aght, as va jeu hene, myr dy beagh eh, fockley magh jeidjys as karail, as craueeaght.”",,,3

"“Oh what a favour the Lord has granted us to meet with a Christian like ourselves, (said the affected widow, looking round her,) we desire to live in charity with all mankind.","“O cre’n foayr ta shin er gheddyn ayns shilley yn Chiarn (dooyrt y ven-treoghe lesh jeeanid, son va’n cree eck lane, as yeeagh ee mygeayrt-y-moie) dy vel eh er chur nyn raad Creestee goll-rooin hene; son ta shinyn myrgeddin geearree dy veaghey ayns shee as caarjys rish ooilley sheelnaue.”","O cre’n foayr ta shin er gheddyn ayns shilley yn Chiarn (dooyrt y ven-treoghe lesh jeeanid, son va’n cree eck lane, as yeeagh ee mygeayrt-y-moie dy vel eh er chur nyn raad Creestee goll-rooin hene; son ta shinyn myrgeddin geearree dy veaghey ayns shee as caarjys rish ooilley sheelnaue.”",,4
"But, to be frank also, Sir, we do not go to mass, nor to confession, for we do not learn from our Testament, which is indeed almost worn out, that we are required to confess to sinners like ourselves, nor to worship the host, nor to perform penance for the salvation of our souls; and we believe we can serve God acceptably in a cave, or in a chamber, or on a mountain.”[14]",,,"[14] The second part of the widow’s speech here, spelling out aspects of Catholic doctrine that Protestants reject, is omitted in the translation.",4
"“I confess, Madam, in my turn, (said M.——,) that I am exceedingly astonished to find such persons on such a spot; pray how many may there be of your sentiments?”","“Shegin dooys myrgeddin goaill rish (dooyrt yn Marchan) dy vel eh jannoo yindys er-skin towse dou, dy gheddyn lhied y slieh as ta shiuish, ayns lheid y voayll.

"He then gave to his attentive and enraptured auditory an outline of the moral changes accomplished by the diffusion of the Bible, the labours of Missionaries, and the establishment of schools; but only such an outline as was suited to their general ignorance of the state of what is called the religious world. And when he had concluded, they all joined in the prayer, —","Dinsh eh daue eisht ayns aght cha baghtal as oddagh eh, yn chaghlaa mooar va ny Scriptyryn er n’obbraghey mastey Sheelnaue, as myrgeddin laboraght ny Shirveishee ve’r nyn goyrt nyn mast’ oc, as ny schoillyn v’er nyn osley son yn ynsagh oc; as tra veh er scuirr loayrt, ghow ad ooilley ayrn lesh jeannyd, as lesh un chree ayns y phadjer.

"The termination of this extraordinary meeting was most affecting; tears of pleasure, gratitude, and regret streamed from the eyes of the mountaineers; and the traveller, though more deeply moved by having seen the grace of God than by all the scenes through which he had passed, went on his way rejoicing, and following the directions of the good widow, he arrived at the town of S——.","Agh nish ve traa daue dy agail nyn mannaght oc, as tra va’d mysh goll roue, va creeaghyn yn sleih wheesh lhieent lesh ennaghtyn dy ghraih as dy hoyrt-booise, nagh voddagh ad freayll veih keayney.

"This testimony, so honourable to his new acquaintance, was confirmed to M.—— from several quarters; and he learnt from others, what he had not been told by themselves, that, besides their honesty and charity, so great is their zeal, that they flock from the different hamlets, and meet in the mountains in cold and bad weather, at eight or nine o’clock at night, to avoid the interruption of their enemies, and to sing and pray.","Va shoh yn feanish s’troshey oddagh ad v’er choyrt da’n Varchan mychione ymmyrkey bea e ainjyssee noa, as cha voddagh eh agh lane taitnys y ghoaill ayn: agh cheu-mooie jeh ooilley shoh cheayll eh lane reddyn mychione oc voish feallagh elley nagh row ad hene er n’insh da.
