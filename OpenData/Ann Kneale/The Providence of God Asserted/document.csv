To the Editor of the Methodist Magazine.,,
"Dear Sir,         Bristol, June 19, 1804",,
"My mind has frequently been a good deal affected by the words of the Holy Psalmist, which he so often repeats in the cviith Psalm, viz. «O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and declare the wonderful works which he doth for the children of men.”” Ought we not then, in obedience to these words, to declare those wonderful works of God which we our- selves have been witnesses of? And may we not do this with all possible simplicity of mind, so that God may be glorified, his truth and faithfulness, his mercy and loving-kindness manifested, and the children of God edified? With this view I send you the following account, which, if you see good, you may insert in the Methodist Magazine",,
"WHEN I was stationed in the city of Norwich in the year 1764, I met with what I think an extraordinary instance of the Power and Goodness of God.[3]","Ayns yn Vlein Un Thousane Shiagh Cheead, as Three feed as Kiare. Va mish er my phointeil dys Norwichch[4], Raad ren mee meeteil rish cowrey yindyssagh jeh Pooar as Mieys Yee. ","[3] The Manx translation gives; ‘In the year 1764, I was appointed to Norwich, where I met with an extraordinary instance of the Power and Goodness of God.’
[4] Va mish er my phointeil dys Norwich] — ‘I was appointed to Norwich’"
"A poor man and his wife had re- moved from Leeds in Yorkshire, and settled in Norwich, where they earned their bread by carding and spinning very coarse wool.","Va Dooinney boght as yn Ven echey er scughey veih Leeds, dys Norwich, raad ren ad toilliu nyn meaghey liorish Kaartey as sneeu ollan feer coorse. ",
". In a few years the man died, and left the poor destitute woman with three small children, in a place where she was but little known, and in a state of deep poverty.","Lurg daue ve ayns shoh blein ny jees hooar yn dooinney baase, as daag eh ben voght treigit marish three dty chloan, ayns boayl nagh row monney ainjys eck, as va’d ayns boghtynid mooar. ",
"However, she laboured with all her might to support her poor children, and sold every thing out of her house that she could possibly spare, even the bed she should have rested her weary body upon.","Ny-yeih, ren ee laboraght lesh ooilley yn niart eck dy veaghey yn chloan gyn ayr, as chreck ee dy chooilley nhee oddagh ee sparail ass y thie, eer yn lhiabbee lhiasagh ve eck dy ghoaill fea er. ",
"She wrought night and day, Sundays as well as other days, and never ceased till, worn out with hard labour, she could hold up no more, and then she lay down upon a heap of wool, and rested awhile, till her wasted strength was somewhat recruited, and then went to work again.","Ren ee laborag[h] Oie as Laa, Jedooney hammey as laaghyn elley, as cha jinnagh ee ghoaill fea, dys v’ee ceaut ass, as cha voddagh ee cummal seose ny soddey, as eisht lhie ee sheesh er konnan[5] dy ollan, dy ghoaill yn aash eck, dys va’n niart eck red-ennaght jeant ass-y-noa, as eisht hie ee dys obbyr reesht. ","[5] KIONNAN, v. the dim. of Kione, a lump less than a head, a bundle; Acts, xxviii. 3; pl. —YN. (Cregeen)"
"Thus she laboured for a considerable time, till one Sunday, as she was washing the floor of her room, upon her knees, the following words were so very deeply impressed upon her mind, that sthe thought a person was really behind her, who said, ““ If you live and die in this manner, you will be lost for ever.""”","Myr shoh ren ee laboraght son tra liauyr, dys un Doonaght, myr v’ee er ny ghlioonyn eck, niee laare yn thie, va ny goan shoh currit dys yn aigney eck lesh lheid yn thrimmid, dys smooinee ee dy row persoon ennaght chooyl eck, ren gra, ""My nee oo beaghey as feddyn baase ayns yn stayd shoh, bee oo callit son dy bragh."" ",
"She looked over her shoulder, and said, “I had much better do so than not be clean.”","Yeeagh ee harrish yn gheaylyn eck, as dooyrt ee, “Te ny share dou jannoo shoh as ve glen.”",
"But, upon serious reflection, she thought within herself, “if I do live and die thus, I shall be lost. Accordingly, she gave up her washing, dressed herself as well as she could, and went directly to the Tabernacle, where that faithful servant of God, the late Mr. John Murlin, was then preaching.","Agh, tra smooinee ee er ny goan, dooyrt ee ree hene, ""My neem beaghey as feddyn baase ayns yn stayd shoh, beem callit son dy bragh.""

"The Lord sent the word with power to her heart, and she was made deeply sensible of her guilty, sinful, and wretched state; so that she turned to the Lord, and earnestly sfought the salvation purchased by the blood of Christ, and through the infinite mercy and love of God, was soon put in possession of that inestimable blessing.","Ren Jee cur ny goan lesh pooar dys yn chree eck, as v’ee jeant tushtagh jeh’n ",
,"stayd callit, kyndagh, as mee-chrauee eck, myr shen dy ren ee chyndaa dys yn Chiarn as ren ee dy jeean shirrey son yn saualtys va Kionit liorish fuill Chreest, as trooid mooayds Myghin as Graih Yee, va’n bannaght mooar shen currit j’ee ayns solley[6].","[6] Solley] SOYLLEY, s. m. enjoyment, fruition, possession. (Cregeen)."
"Being made unspeakably happy in the love of God, she now went on her way, greatly rejoicing, notwithstanding her deep poverty.","Vee nish erskyn towse maynrey ayns Graih Yee, as hie ee er yn raad eck, ghoaill lane boggey, gha dy row ee ayns yn boghtynid smoo. ",
"In the time of her distress, the Minister of the parish of St. Andrew, where she lived, had been so kind as to relieve her by granting her the privilege of having broken victuals from his table. But when he heard of the change which had taken place in the poor woman, he sent for her to his house.","Ayns tra yn seaghyn, as yn boghtynid eck, va Saghyrt yn skeerey v’ee beaghey ayn, as aeh cha dooie r’ee as dy lowal ny wooilliaghtyn[7] veagh ec yn voard echey hene dy ve currit j’ee. Aght tra cheayll eh jeh’n caghlaa v’er ghoaill toshiaght ayns yn Ven voght, hug eh fys urree gys eh hie. ","[7] wooilliaghtyn—] fooilliaghtyn—‘leavings’, ‘left-overs’."
"She being apprehensive that his design was to persuade her to renounce the Methodists, was exceedingly distressed; but she earnestly cried to the Lord, intreating him to appear for her in this trying hour, and that he would give her such courage and resolution, that she might boldly confess him before men.","V’ee ouryssagh dy row ah yn smooinaghtyn echey dy choyrlagh ee dy hreigeil ny Methodistyn, as v’ee dy mooar seaghnit, agh phrayll ee dty jeean dys yn Chiarn, guee er dy ve maree ayns yn oor dy hrial, as dy jinnagh eh cur leid yn dunnalys j’ee, dy voddagh ee goaill rish Creest kiongoyrt rish deiney.",
"She was not in any degree concerned about any thing the Minister might either say or do, so she might only stand fast in the faith, and not defile her conscience.","Cha row ee er aght erbee neu-aasagh mysh red erbee yennagh yn Saghyrt gra ny jannoo, myr shen dy voddagh ee shassoo shickyr sy chreadjue, as dyn dy chur lesh deyrey er yn cooinsheans eck. ",
"In this spirit she went to his house, and he said, ““I hear you are turned Wheatlamite.”” (So they called the Methodists in Norwich, in those days, from James Wheatley, who had preached in that city.)[8]","Ayns yn spyrryd shoh hie ee dys yn thie echey, as dooyrt eh ree, ““Ta mee clashtyn dy vel oo er hyndaa Wheatlamite.” (son shoh va ny Methodistyn enmysit ayns Norwich, er yn oyr dy row James Wheatley, unnane jeh ny Preachooryn va dy sy Valley.)[9]","[8] ‘(So they called the Methodists in Norwich, in those days, from James Wheatley, who had preached in that city.)’— the Manx translation gives ‘(for this is what the Methodists were called in Norwich, because James Wheatley was one of the preachers in that city.)’

"She answered, ""No, Sir, I am become a Methodist.""","Dansoor ish, ""Cha vel, Vainshter, agh ta mee er jeet dy ve Methodist.""",
"He replied, with some degree of anger, ""What! is it not enough to go to the Church?""","Dreggyr eshyn, ayns corree: ""Cre’d? cha vel ah dy liooar dy gholl dys yn Keeill?""",
"She answered, ""Before I was a Methodist, I went to no place of worship; but now I constantly attend the Church.""","Dansoor ish, ""Roish my row mish Methodist, Cha jagh mee dys boayl wooashlee erbee; agh nish ta mee tendeil yn Keeill dy kinjaght."" ",
"He then said, ""And are you determined to continue a Methodist ?""","Eisht dooyrt eh, ""As vel oo kairit dy hannaghtyn dy ve Methodist?""",
"She replied, ""Yes, Sir, through the help of God, I trust I shall.""-","Dreggyr ish, ""Ta, Vainshter, trooid cooney Yee, ta mee treishteil dy jean.""",
"""Well then,"" said he, ""you need expect no farther relief from me.""","""Feer vie"" dooyrt eshyn, eisht, ""cha lhiass dhyt jerkal rish arragh dy cooney voyms.""",
"She answered, ""I am exceedingly obliged to you, Sir, for all past favours, and I heartily thank both God and you, for the great kindness you have so long shewn me, and as you certainly have a right to give your broken victuals to whom you think proper, I am perfectly satisfied.""","Dansoor ish, ""Ta mish lane kainlt ayns booise diuish, Vainshter, son yn foayr mooar ta shiu er yeeaghyn dou, as ta mee cur booise creeoil hammey da Jee as diuish, son yn ghiastyllys ta shiu choud er chur dou, as shickyr ta cair diu choyrt ny wooillaghtyn da quoi erbee ta shiu fakin mie, as ta mish booiagh.""",
"The Minister made good his word, and the poor woman returned home, greatly rejoicing, and heartily praising God, for giving her strength according to her day, and for enabling her to confess him, and to avow herself a Methodist.","Ren yn Saghyrt jannoo mie yn fockle echey, as hyndaa yn Ven voght thie, ghoaill lane boggey, as dty creeoil moylley Jee, son cur niart jee cordail rish yn laa eck, as son cooney l’ee dy ghoaill rish dy row ee Methodist. ",
"Soon after this a man married her, who supported both her and her children, so that she lived comfortably the residue of her days, and experienced the truth of the Apostle's words : ""Godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.""","Ayns tra giare lurg shoh ren Dooinney Poosey ee, ren beaghey ec hene as yn cloan eck, myr shen dy cheau ee yn cooid elley jeh ny laghyn eck ayns gerjagh-, as ren ee fakin as yennaghtyn firrinys goan yn Ostyl.
