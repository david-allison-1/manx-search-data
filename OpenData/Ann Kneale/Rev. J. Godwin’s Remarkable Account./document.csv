,Coontey jeh Dooinney Seyr ayns Wisbeach[1],[1] Coontey jeh Dooinney Seyr ayns Wisbeach] — ‘An Account of a Gentleman in Wisbech’
"The Rev. J. Godwin[2], Pastor of a Dissenting Congregation, at Wisbeach, gives the following remarkable Account.[3]",Ta’n Preachoor ta coyrt yn coontey (Mr. Godwin) as eh loayrt myr shoh.,"[2] John Godwin was appointed a Congregationalist minister in Wisbech in 1746. 
[3] The Manx translation gives: ‘The preacher who gives the account is Mr Godwin, and he speaks thus:’"
"IN the year 1749, a gentleman came to reside in this town. He seemed to be a person well educated; but so wicked in his conversation, that the sober part of the town shunned his company. After he had been some time here, he was seized with a violent disorder, which confined him to his bed; and was under great terror of mind.","Ayns yn Vlein Un Thousane Shiagh cheead, as Nuy as daa-eed. Haink Dooinney seyr dy veaghey ayns yn valley shoh. V’eh jeeaghyn myr persoon va ynsit dy ard; agh v’eh cha mee-chrauee ayns yn ymmyrkey bea echey, dy ren yn sleih sheelt va sy valley chea yn sheshaght echey. Lurg da ve ayns shoh tra giare, v’eh goit lesh chingys trome[4], as v’eh myrgeddin fo atchim mooar. ",[4] chingys trome] ‘heavy illness’
"In this situation, he sent for me. I found him very ill in bed; but thoroughly sensible. He told me he was glad to see me, and desired I would pray by him.","Ayns yn stayd shoh hug eh fys orrym’s. As tra hie mee[5], hooar mee eh ny lhie er lhiabbee dy hingys.[6] Dinsh eh dou dy row eh feer wooiagh dy akin mee, as ren eh geearree orrym dy phrayl marish. ","[5] as tra hie mee] ‘and when I went’
[6] ny lhie er lhiabbee dy hingys] ‘lying on a a sickbed’"
"Before I did this, I desired he would give me an account of his former life. On which he said, “My father, who was a sober, godly man, died when I was young, and left a very plentiful fortune behind him. My mother was very fond of me, and sent me to London for education;[7]","Roish my ren mee shoh, dooyrt mee rish dy beign booiagh dy jinnagh eh cur coontey dou jeh’n ymmyrkey bea echey sy tra va ceaut. Er-shen dooyrt eh, “Va my Ayr Dooinney sheelt, as crauee, hooar eh baase tra va mish feer aeg, as daag eh lane cooid seihllt dou. Va my Voir feer  dooie rhym as hug ee mee dy Lunnin dys schoill","[7] ‘My father, ... for education;’ the Manx gives; ‘My father was a sober man, and godly. He died when I was very young, and he left a very plentiful fortune to me. My mother was very kind to me, and sent me to London to school.’"
"where, being naturally very gay, I soon contracted acquaintance with many loose and wicked: youths, and was guilty of almost all sorts of wickedness. But notwithstanding this, I read the scriptures, and prayed every morning and night! But now, alas! my sins stare me in the face; and I believe I am beyond the reach of mercy.”[8]","ayns shen ren mee ainjys rish shartanse dy sleih aegey va feer mee-chrauee va sheen[9] er-lhiam Kyndagh jeh dy chooilley vonney dy pheccah. Ny-yeih lurg ooilley shoh Ren mee lhaih Goo Yee as prayl dy chooilley Oie as Moghrey: Agh nish, alas ta my pheccaghyn kiongoyrt rish my oaie as ta mee credjal dy vel ad erskyn roshtyn pardoon.","[8] The manx translation of this section gives; ‘where I contracted acquaintence with several youths who were very wicked: I imagine, guilty of all sorts of sin. But notwithstanding this, I read God’s Word, and prayed every morning and night! But now, alas! my sins stare me in the  face and I believe that they are beyond the reach of pardon.”’

"When he had given me this account, I prayed with him, and set before him the fulness of Christ: and told him how able and willing he was to save all that came unto him. I then went away, and left him a little better; but still under great terror of mind, which continued some days.","Lurg da v’er choyrt yn coontey shoh dou Ren mee prayl marish as ren mee soiaghey kiongoyrt rish yn laanid v’ayns Creest: as cre cha fondagh as cha booiagh as v’eh dy hauail dy chooilley unnane yennagh cheet huggey Eisht daag mee eh red beg share, agh v’eh foast fo atchim mooar as ren eh tannaghtyn myr shen son laaghyn.",
"However I visited him every day, and after a while he seemed to have some hopes.","Ny-yeih hie mee dy chur shilley er dy chooilley laa, as ny lurg shen v’eh jeeaghyn dy row treishteil ennagh echey",
"But one day when I came to see him, I found him more discouraged than ever, and quite in despair. On enquiring how he was, he answered, “No hope! No mercy!”","Agh un laa tra hie mee dy chur shilley er, hooar mee dy row eh er choayl eh chree ny smoo ny v’eh rieau as v’eh fo mee-chredjue. Dennee mee jeh cre’n aght v’eh, Dansoor eh, “Cha vel treishteil! Cha vel myghin!”",
"I asked, what was the matter? He said, “Last night I dreamed, Satan came to me, and told me, “It is in vain for thee to expect mercy; for in a very short time thou wilt be with me for ever.”","Dennee mee jeh, cre’n oyr va son eh heaghyn? Dansoor eh, “Ren mee dreamal Riar, dy daink yn Drogh-Spyrryd hym, as dy dinsh eh dou, “dy row ah ayns fardail dou dy yerkal rish myghin; son ayns tra giare veign marish son dy bragh.”",
"But though I reasoned with him, and told him this was only a chimera, and the effect of his distemper; it was all in vain, I therefore left him full as bad as I found him.","Gha dy ren mee resooney rish, as ginsh da nagh row ah veg agh smooinaghtyn fardailagh, as dy reh yn Doghan echey va’n oyr jeh, Ny-yeih va’n resooney aym ooilley ayns fardail. As daag mee eh ooilley cooidjagh cha olk as hooar mee eh.",
"However, I went again the next day, and found him much in the same mind. I went again the day after, which was Friday, and then, to my great surprise, found him rejoicing in Christ. I then asked him what this alteration was owing to?","Ny-yeih, hie mee yn laa ergyn dy chur shilley er, as cha row eh veg share. Hie mee laa-ny-vairagh, va shen Jeheney, as, dys yn yindys mooar aym, hooar mee eh ghoaill boggey ayns Chreest. Vrie mee jeh cre’n oyr va son yn caghlaa mooar shoh,",
"He answered, “Last night I dreamed that Jesus Christ came to me, and told me my sins were forgiven, and that Satan was still a liar, and bid me not fear! And now, Sir, said he, you may think this is a chimera. But I give you this as a sign. It is now Friday; if this is true, I shall die on the Lord's-day, at three o'clock in the afternoon. If I die then, you may conclude I am saved. But if I pass that time, or die before, I shall not be saved.","Dansoor eh, “Riar ren mee dreamal dy daink Yeesey Creest hym, as dy dinsh eh dou dy row my pheccaghyn leiht dou, as dy row yn Drogh-Spyrryd still ny vreageyreh, as dooyrt eh rhym dyn dy ghoaill aggle!

Agh my neem goll shaghey yn tra shen, ny feddyn baase rosih shen, Cha beem er my hauail.",
"This he spoke with great cheerfulness; and whenever I visited him after that, I always found him very comfortable. On the Lord's-day, I called on him in the forenoon, and found him triumphing in the God of his salvation. I called again after the morning-service, and found him still the same.","Ren eh loayrt ny goan shoh lesh lane gennalys; as Keayrt erbee dy jagh mee dy yeeaghyn eh ny lurg shen, hooar mee eh feer vaynrey. Moghrey Laa-yn-Chiarn, Hie mee dy yeeaghyn eh, as hooar mee eh goaill boggey ayns Jee eh Haualtagh. Dilley mee reesht lurg Shirveish, as hooar mee eh syn un aght.",
"After dinner, (at one o'clock) I met the physician there. I took him aside, and without giving him any reason, desired to know what he thought of his patient?[10] The physician said, He is in a very bad way; but in no immediate danger.","Lurg Jehnhear. (mysh[11] unnane er y chlag) Hie mee as veet mee yn Er-lhee ayn. As vrie mee jeh cre v’eh coontey jeh’n Dooinney shoh?

[12] nagh row eh feer faggys da’n vaase.] ‘that he was not near to death’."
"I then went into the room, took leave of him, and went to the Meeting.[13]","Eisht hie mee stiagh ayns shamyr yn Dooinney seyr, dy loayrt rish, as veih shen hie mee dys yn Meeteil. ","[13] The Manx translation gives; ‘I then went into the gentleman’s room, to speak to him, and from there I went to the meeting.’"
"As I came back, I called again, and asked how he was? and was told by the nurse, “He died as the clock struck Three!”","Myr va mee cheet thie, Dilley mee, dy vriaght cre’n aght v’eh? as dinsh unnane jeh ny sharvantyn dou, “Dy d’hooar eh baase myr va’n chlag boailley Three!”",
