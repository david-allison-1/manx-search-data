"The Methodist Magazine, vol. XXII, 1799, pp. 560-3.",,
Anecdote on Family Religion,Coontey Yindysagh jeh Eirinnagh As Masoonagh.[1],[1] The title in Manx can be translated as ‘A wonderous account of a farmer and a mason’. In some parts of the translation masoonagh (‘mason’)   is used where ‘builder’ appears in the original text.
"About the year 1762, (says the pious minister,) I observed a man whose complexion indicated something of an uncommon dejection of spirit; the features of his face appeared to have been considerably changed by a long series of soul concern.","Ta’n Preachoor ta choyrt yn coontey as eh loayrt myr shoh.[2] Mysh yn vlein Un Thousane Shiagh cheead, as Three-feed as jees.

"Upon enquiry, I soon found that he lived about two miles from the  place of worship.","Liorish briagh, Hooar mee magh dy row eh chummal mysh daa veeley veih’n boal wooashlee ain.",
"I judged, from the distress I was persuaded he must be in, that I should be a welcome visiter at his house. Accordingly I went, and[3] knocked at his door: But upon seeing me, he appeared much confused; and at first, my expectations of having such a welcome, were quite disappointed.[4]","Ren mee briwnys, veih’n seaghyn v’eh jeeaghyn dy ve foo, dy beign persoon veagh eh booiagh fakin ec eh hie. Er shen hie mee, as thra rosht mee chronk mee ec yn dorrys: Agh thra honnick eh mee v’eh ceaut bun-ry-skyn; as hoshiaght, ghow mee aggle dy beign mollit, ayns dy beagh eh booiagh fakin mee.","[3] The Manx translation adds; ‘when I arrived’
[4] The Manx translation gives; ‘I was afraid that I would be disappointed in (assuming) that he would be pleased to see me.’"
"After some recollection, he bid me follow him. He then led me across the house into a back parlour[5]. After sitting down, he accosted me in the following manner:","Ny-yeih lurg da smooinaghtyn red beg, hir eh orrym cheet stiagh. Lurg dooin v’er hoie sheese, loayr eh rhym er yn aght shoh:",[5] The Manx translation simply gives ‘he asked me to come in’.
"“You will think my conduct singular, but I tell you I dare not shake hands with you, because I know it will make my hell the hotter: Nor can I sit opposite to you when you preach, for I am persuaded you will appear against me at the Judgment-Day. While you speak to convinced sinners, I know that I am a convinced sinner; but when you mention the comforts such frequently enjoy after conviction, I am fully convinced that I have never received any comfort at all. , Though I am possessed of an estate, and have a good trade, and an agreeable family: yet I am miserable in the midst of all, and enjoy nothing; for I live under this impression, that “I am sure of going to hell.” He spoke these words like one who fully believed what he said.","“Foddee shiuish coontey mish persoon feer yindyssagh ayns yn aght aym, Agh ta mee ginsh diu ny by-loys dou craa laueyn riu, son ta fys aym dy jean ah yn niurin aym ny s’choh: Chamoo oddym soie jeeragh erriu tra ta shiu preacheil, son ta mee shickyr jeh dy jean shiu gymmyrkey feanish m’oi er Laa ny Briwnys.

"Upon asking him, How long he had been in this unhappy frame of mind? He answered, “Seven years.”","Dennee mee jeh, Caid v’eh ayns yn stayd neu-vaynrey shoh? Dansoor eh, “Shiagh bleeaney.”",
"I asked him, How, and in what manner he came to be in such a despairing way? He said, “I went to persecute and abuse Mr. Grimshaw, (it was the great Mr. Grimshaw of Haworth, who then lived within a few miles of him[6],) and I was struck with horror, and have been in distress ever since.”","Eisht dennee mee jeh, Cre’n oyr, as cre’n aght haink eh dy ve foo mee-chredjue.

[7] yn Dooinney mie shen] ‘that good Man’ ; added by the translator."
"The length of the time that he had been in this distressing situation, was that which surprized me more than any other circumstance.[8]",,[8] This line is missing from the Manx translation.
"I asked him,–If he was willing to comply with any advice I should think proper to give him, in this gloomy situation? He readily answered in the affirmative.","Dennee mee jeh, beagh eh booiagh jannoo ny yinnin cur coyrle da, Ren eh dy arryltagh gra dy jinnagh.",
"After mentioning what I wished him to read, I requested him to begin family-prayer; he having first promised that whatever I should think proper to advise he would comply with. I then called his wife into the room; she was a woman that made no profession of religion at that time, but I thought her compliance would help him over the difficulty, and asked her, If she had any objection to his beginning to pray in the family?[9]","Lurg dou v’er chur red beg dy coyrle as er n’insh da ny va mee laccal eh dy lhaih, ren mee geearree dy jinnagh eh toshiaght er freayll Padjer Lught-thie;  Eisht loayr mee rish yn Ven echey, as dooyrt mee r’ee, dy row mee jerkal nagh beagh veg eck n’oi yn sheshey eck son freayll Padjer Lught thie? —","[9] The Manx translation of this paragraph is somewhat shorter; ‘After giving him a little advice and telling him  what I wanted him to read, I asked him to begin family-prayer. Then I spoke to his wife, and I said to her that I was expecting that she wouldn’t have an objection to her husband holding family-prayer.’"
"“No.” I then told her, I hoped that she herself would see that it was never neglected; to which she readily consented. I engaged him also to call in all his servants and children.","Dansoor ee, Nagh beagh.[10] Dooyrt mee er-y-fa shen r’ee, dy row mee treishteil dy jinnagh ee fakin nagh beagh ah jarroodit; dooyrt ee dy jinnagh.

"He had at that time one of the most abandoned men in the whole country, building a farmer’s barn for him; this man, having been remarkable for his persecuting religious persons, laughed aloud as the master was praying.[11] Having done this repeatedly, one morning a little before the time for family devotion, (my friend,) who had prayed now several times with his family, felt his heart fail him so much, on account of the scorn and contempt of this master builder, that he secreted himself, supposing his wife would think him called away on some urgent business, and therefore he could omit the duty for once;[12]","Va masoonee echey yn thra shen troggal soalt noa, as va’n Mainshter oc unnane jeh ny drogh yentee smoo ayns yn slane cheer, as ren eh lane tranlaase er pobble Yee.

[12] The Manx translation gives: ‘He did this repeatedly, until the master of the house’s courage failed in carrying out his duty, because of the builder’s mockery, and one morning he thought that he would hide and that he could escape from his duty for once, supposing his wife would think that he was needed in a hurry for some reason.’
[13] scapail—can be causative in Manx, so can be used for ‘rescuing’ as well as ‘escaping’."
"but she perceived him walk towards the brewhouse, and when the time for prayer came; not seeing him come in as usual, she went into the brewhouse, rather suspecting he had got out of the way on account of this man, and found her frightened husband hid behind the brewing vessels.[14]","Ny-yeih hug yn ven tastey da goll roish, as tra haink oor yn phadjer, cha row eh ry-akin cheet myr v’eh cliaghtey, as hie ee er eh eiyrtys, ouryssagh dy row eh er gholl ass yn raad er coontey yn Masoonagh.

She went into the brew-house, and she found her husband there, hid behind the brewing vessels.’"
"She immediately accosted him, “My love, come out, come out! did not the Minister make me promise that I would see family prayer performed, and would I be discouraged by yonder foolish fellow? I begin now to like it myself, it makes us look so orderly and re- gular.” I have repeatedly heard him say, he followed his wife as a bear to a stake, scarcely knowing how he should get through the performance that morning.[15]","As dooyrt ee, “OO my Heshey, tar magh, tar magh! nagh ren yn Preachoor cur orrym gialdyn nagh beagh padjer lught-thie lhiggit shaghey, as beign freaylt veih my churrym er coontey yn ommydan shid?

Come out! Did not the Minister make me promise that Family Prayer would not be neglected, and would I be kept from my duty on account of yonder foolish fellow? I myself am someone who takes pleasure in it, because it keeps order amongst us.” I have heard him say since, that he followed his wife like a bear to a stake, not knowing how he should get through the prayer."
,"Agh t’eh rayt, Bee beeal dy chooilley olkys er ny yeigh.[16]",[16] Translator’s addition.
"This uncommon persecutor, perceiving that his laughing had caused some disturbance, was determined that at that time he would refrain from making any noise, but did not know how to avoid it, till he contrived to fill his mouth with the coat of his companion, which he did in so complete a manner, that he thought, however he might be diverted, he could not now make any noise.[17] ","Hug yn Masoonagh my-ner, dy row yn garaghtee echey er ghoostey anvea sy thie, as v’eh kiarit dy reayll eh hene foo smaght yn keayrt shen, as tra ren ad gliooney ren eh lhieeney eh veeal lesh chooat unnane jeh eh heshaghyn masoonee, ren eh shoh er lheid yn aght as dy smooinee, eh dy voddagh eh ghamman hene ve echey, as foast fegooish jannoo feiyr. ","[17] The Manx gives ‘The mason perceived that his laughing had caused some disturbance in the house, and was determined to keep himself under control on that occasion, and when they knelt he stuffed his mouth with the coat of one of his fellow masons. He did this in such a way that he thought that he could have his own fun, and yet without making a noise. "
"But God, whose ways are as much higher than our ways, as the heavens are above the earth, while he had his mouth filled with his companion’s coat, struck him with an arrow of conviction to the very heart. No sooner had the master concluded his praying, than the bricklayer stole from his workmen into a private corner, and wept, and confessed his sin, under the most awful apprehension of his lost condition.[18]","Agh ta Jee er ghra, Myr ta ny niaughyn ny syrjey na yn thalloo, myr shen ta ny raaidyn aym’s ny syrjey na ny raaidyn euish, as ny smooinaghtyn aym’s erskyn ny smooinaghtyn euish, choud as va beeal yn Masoonagh myr shoh lhieent lesh chooat eh heshey, v’eh bwoailt lesh side yn Ooilley-Niartal, as v’eh, myr ta Job er ghra, Va atchimyn Yee soiaghey ad hene ayns order caggee n’oi.3 As cha leah as va’n Mainshter er chur jerrey er eh phadjer, ren yn Masoonagh goll roish dys corneil follit, veih ny masoonee elley, as ayns shen ren eh dobberan, as ghoaill rish eh pheccaghyn, ayns yn aght s’trimshagh.","[18] But, God has said, As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts. Whilst the mouth of the mason was filled with his partner’s coat in this way, he was struck by the bolt of the Almighty, and it was, as Job has said, that God’s terrors were setting themselves in battle-order against him. And as soon as the master of the house had concluded his praying, than the bricklayer stole from his workmen into a private corner, and wept, and confessed his sins in the most mournful manner."
"He told me, he thought he prayed forty times that day. His distress was such, that he has been frequently frozen to the ground while wrestling with God for the pardon of his sins. , The frost at that time was very severe,[19] and he had to go through a road in his way to his work, in which he generally spent some time in prayer; and there was immediately a visible change in the man’s whole conduct. Now he who had held the preaching of God’s word in such contempt, heard it preached with the greatest attention. The whole neighbourhood were surprised to see such a change. I had about two months before this time, seen him in some company, and thought when I saw the man, that there appeared in him something of a hardness peculiar to such persecutors. I remember saying, That if there was such a thing, as a man on the earth whom God could not change, he was the man.","Dinsh eh dou, ny lurg shen, dy row eh credjal dy row eh ec padjer da-eed keayrt yn laa shen.

This distress continued about five months; in which time he mostly thought he had sinned beyond the reach of pardon.,Ren eh heaghyn[21] tannaghtyn mysh Queig meeghyn as ayns yn thra shen v’eh faggys aarloo dy smooinaghtyn dy row ny peccaghyn echey erskyn roshtyn pardoon.,[21] eh heaghyn]—e heaghyn—‘his distress’
"He was then near thirty years of age, and had not felt any convictions for eleven years, though he had lived in all kinds of sin, murder excepted.","V’eh ec yn thra shen mysh Jeih Bleeaney as Feed dy eash, as cha row eh er n’ennaghtyn dherrhey erbee son peccah rish Un Vlein jeig gha dy row eh beaghey ayns dy chooilley vonney dy pheccah, er-lhimmey jeh Dunverys.",
"In Satan’s cause he had few equals; and for persecuting God’s people, I suppose, there were not any in all the villages round about like him.[22]","Er-lhiam dy row eh unnane jeh ny sharvaantyn s’firrinee va ec yn drogh-spyrryd ayns eh hirveish, as son jannoo tranlaase er pobble Yee, cha row lheid echey ry-yeddyn.","[22] The Manx translation gives: ‘I think that he was one of the truest servants of the Devil in his service, and for persecuting  God’s people there was no match for him to be found.’"
"About eleven years before this distress, as far as I remember, he read some part of Bunyan’s works, which a person had put into his hands: The reading of this book threw him into great conviction for some hours, but going with his wicked companions to the alehouse, he soon got rid of his trouble, and lived in as hardened a frame as I ever knew any man, till God struck his heart under this prayer.[23] ","Mysh un vlein jeig roish v’eh ayns yn seaghyn shoh, ren eh lhaih ayrn ennagh jeh scrieu Bunyan, As v’eh son tra giare dy mooar seaghnit, agh hie eh reesht marish eh heshaghyn mee-chrauee gys yn thie-oast, as hooar eh r’eh rish eh heaghyn, as ren eh beaghey ayns yn creoghys smoo va rieau fys aym er dooinney beaghey ayn, Dys ren Jee fakin ah mie, dy woalley eh lesh oayrd eh ghoo breeoil, as dy vrishey yn cree clagh echey.","[23] The Manx translation gives; ‘About eleven years before he was experiencing this distress, he read some part of Bunyan’s works, and he was, for a short while, greatly troubled, but he went back to the alehouse with his ungodly mates, and he got rid of his trouble, and lived in as hardened a frame as I ever knew any man to live, till  God saw good to strike him with the hammer of his potent word, and to break his heart of stone.’"
"When God had humbled him about five months, he filled him with a sense of his pardoning love; and when he joined himself a member to the church, it might truly be said of him, “As iron sharpeneth iron, so does the countenance of a man his friend,” for the account he gave of himself surprised and pleased all who heard, but especially those who had been witnesses both to his life in sin, and the particular manner in which God had called him. ","Lurg da Jee v’er n’injillagh eh mysh Queig meeghyn, ren eh eisht lhieeney eh lesh eh ghraih, as v’eh abyl gra, myr dooyrt Thomas, My Hiarn as my Yee.

"I remember the first words he spoke before the people were, “If ever man could say, Grace is free, I am the person.” He then gave a short, but full account of the whole. He is now, I expect, in that world where they behold without weariness, the wonders of redeeming love,[26]","Ta cooinaghtyn aym er ny chied focklyn loayr eh ec yn Meeteil ain, (shoh va’d) “My oddys dooinney bio gra, dy vel Grayse as ah nastee, Mish yn persoon.” Eisht hug eh slane coontey dooin jeh ny v’er daghyrt, as dy row Jee er leih da trooid Creest.

Namely; “If ever a living man could say that there is Grace and that it is  free, I am the person.” 
He then gave us a full account of what had happened; that God had forgiven him through Christ. He is now, I steadfastly believe, in that land where they behold, without weariness, the wondrous love of the Lamb.’"
"The master of the house, who prayed, and had been seven years in such a gloomy situation, knocked at my study door one Sabbath morning, about six weeks after I had seen him at his own house: The first moment I saw him, I was surprised with the change in his countenance, his horror and distress having been so long, had, in a measure, furrowed his face, till he was the very picture of grief; but now I never saw a countenance more changed: He looked on me with such a smile, as one may imagine the redeemed will see in one another’s faces, when they meet in the heavenly Canaan;[27]","Mysh Shey shiaghtinyn lurg dou ve ec thie yn Eirinnagh, as er chur coyrle da dy reayll Padjer Lught-thie, Haink eh dy my yeeaghyn: Tra honnick mee eh, va yindys mooar orrym, jeh’n caghlaa v’ayns cummey eh eddin, son va’n atchim as yn seaghyn v’eh er ve foo son shiaght bleeaney, er chur lesh eh dys stayd thrimjagh; Agh nish yeeagh eh orrym lesh lheid yn gennalys, dys smooinee mee, cre’n gennalys yinnagh yn sleih crauee fakin ayns eddinyn echelley[28], tra nee ad meeteil ayns yn Canaan Flaunysagh;—","[27] The Manx translation of this section gives; ‘About six weeks after I had been at the farmer’s house, and had advised him to hold Family Prayer, he came to see me.

"something like that was this meeting: He held out his hand, saying, “Brother, brother, I now can call you brother;”—and then informed me in what manner God had set his soul at liberty. I saw in this man what I never saw in any other:—His first joy continued in a measure uninterrupted for fifteen months. Since then God has called several of his children, who like himself, are marching on towards that company where all real experienced christians shall meet to part no more.[29]","Red ennagh myr shoh va’n meeteil ain.
