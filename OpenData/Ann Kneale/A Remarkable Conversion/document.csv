"A Few weeks ago[2], a man went one evening to a prayer-meeting, where he was awakened by the mighty power of God, to a discovery of his sinfulness, guilt, and helplessness:","Ayns yn Vlein, Un Thousane, Shiagh Cheead as Kiare feed as Queig jeig. Hie Dooinney fastyr dy row dys Meeteil phadjer, raad veh er ny ghoostey liorish pooar yn Ooilley-Niartal, dy akin shilley jeh’n Vee-vialluys, as yn Vee-chraueeaght echey.

"He cried for mercy with all his might, and the Lord graciously heard and saved him in the time of distress, and filled his soul with peace and joy. His happiness was so great, that upon returning home, he could not conceal it, but informed his wife that he had found the Lord.","Deie eh er son Myghin lesh ooilley eh niart, as ren yn Chiarn ayns myghin clashtyn as sauail eh ayns tra eh heaghyn, as va’n annym echey lhieent lesh Shee as lesh boggey. Va’n vaynreys echey wheesh, nagh dod eh keiltyn ah, as tra hooar eh thie, dinsh eh da’n Ven echey dy row eh er yeddyn yn Chiarn. ",
"She begged of him to... “hold his tongue with his nonsense;”. adding,”if there be such a thing to be known, I will never tell any body.”",“Ghuee ish er dy chummal eh hengey lesh eh ommijys;” Son “my va lheid er haghyrt jee’s nagh row ee er ninsh ah da persoon bio.”,
"On Sunday morning, the woman dreamed that she must go to the church that forenoon, and she would hear and know something which she had never known before.","Moghrey yn Doonaght ergyn, ren yn Ven dreamal dy beign jee goll dys yn Keeill yn moghrey shen, as dy jinnagh ee clashtyn as feddyn fys er red-ennagh nagh row rieau fys eck er roie.",
"Accordingly she went, and while the Minister was preaching, she was struck by a few words which he spoke concerning the Blood of Jesus Christ;[3] she began to tremble, and presently fell down in the pew, crying out aloud for mercy.","Er shen hie ee, as thra va’n Saggyrt Preacheil, loayr eh jeh Fuill Yeesey Creest; Ren ny goan goaill lheid yn greme urree, dys v’ee er-creau, as huitt ee sheese raad v’ee, ghuee dy jeean er son myghin.",[3] ‘she was struck by a few words which he spoke concerning the Blood of Jesus Christ;’ — the Manx translation gives; ‘he spoke of the blood of Jesus Christ; the words took such a hold upon her that’
"The husband, seeing her distress, kneeled down for her, and in a little time the Lord set her soul at liberty. The deliverance she experienced was so great and unexpected,[4] that she forgot the ordinary rules of prudence, and praised the Lord aloud for his wonderful mercy.","Tra honnick yn Sheshey eck yn seaghyn vee ayn, glioon eh sheese dy phrayl  er son eck, as ayns tra giare ren yn Chiarn soiagh ee ec reamys. Va’n livrey-ys ren ee gennaghtyn as ah wheesh, dy yarrood ee oardaghyn cadjin yn Keeill, as ren ee moylley Jee dy ard son eh vyghin yindyssagh.",[4] ‘and unexpected’ — missing from the Manx translation.
"The congregation being alarmed, the Minister came out of the pulpit, and enquired, “What is the reason of all this confusion?” The woman requested him to join with her in praising the Lord, for he had pardoned all her sins, and she never thought there was such a thing to be known.","Va’n slane sheshaght as ad ceaut bun-ry-skyn, Eisht haink yn Saggyrt sheese ass yn Pulpit, as denee eh, “Cre’n oyr va son ooilley yn anvea shoh?” Ren yn Ven geearree er dy yoinal maree ayns moylley Jee, son dy row eh er leih jee ooilley ny peccaghyn eck, as nagh row ish rieau credjal dy row fys rish lheid yn red.",
"The Minister said, “You are beside yourself!”","Eisht dooyrt yn Saggyrt r’ee, “T’ou ass dty cheeayl!”",
"“No, Sir, she replied, I am perfectly sensible,”","“Cha vel, Vainshter, dreggyr ee, ta mish dy mie ayns my cheeayl.” ",
He then asked her the following Questions before all the congregation:,Eisht hug eh Questionyn urree Kiongoyrt rish yn Chaglym-cooidjagh: (myr shoh) ,
1.”Who is God?”.,Q.1. “Quoi ta Jee?,
"A. “He is that Almighty Being who made the World, and who upholds all things by the Word of his Power, and before whom we must all appear to give an account of the deeds done in the body.”","A. “Teh yn Ooilley-Niartal ta er chroo yn Seihll, as ta cummal seose dy chooilley nee liorish eh Phooar, as kiongoyrt rishyn shegin dooin ooilley shassoo dy chur coontey son ny reddyn ta jeant ayns yn challin”.",
Q. 2. “Who is Christ? “,Q.2. “Quoi ta Creest?”,
"A. “He is the Redeemer of the World, and I feel the blessed effects of his precious Blood in my soul, redeeming me from the power of Darkness.”","A. “T’eh Saualtagh yn Seihll, as ta mish gennaghtyn bree yn Uill deyr echey ayns my annym, sauail mee veih pooar yn Dorraghys.",
Q. 3. “Who is the Holy Ghost?”.,Q.3. “Quoi yn Spyrryd Noo?,
"A. “The Holy Ghost is the Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, and I feel that he bears witness with my Spirit that I am a child of God.”","A. “Ta’n Spyyryd Noo yn Spyrryd ta cheet magh veih’n Ayr as veih’n Mac, as ta mish gennaghtyn dy vel eh gymmyrkey feanish lesh yn Spyrryd ayms dy vel mee my lhiannoo dy Yee.”",
"Upon receiving these answers to his interrogatories, the minister left her, and ordered the clerk to put her out of the church: When the clerk came to the pew-door[5], he was so affected, that he did not touch her. The church-wardens were then ordered to turn her out; but they refused to interfere in the business.","Lurg da’n Saggyrt v’er yeddin ny ansooryn shoh, daag eh ee, as doardee eh da’n Cleragh dy chur magh ee ass yn Keeill: Tra haink yn Cleragh dys raad v’ee ny hoie, cha dod eh cur laue urree.

"Upon which the minister went out of the church, and soon after the woman and all the congregation followed him.","Er shen hie yn Saggyrt hene roish magh, as ayns tra giare ren yn Ven as yn Chaglym cooidjagh goll magh geiyrt er.",
"As she passed by the minister in the church-yard, she said, “O Sir, your soul is as dead to God as the corpses that lie in these graves.”","As myr va’n Ven goll shaghey yn Saggyrt sy raulick, dooyrt ee, “Oh Vainshter, ta’n annym euish cha marroo dys Jee as ta ny chirp ta nyn lhie ayns ny oaiaghyn shoh.”",
"Upon which the people gave a shout, saying, “She is a Methodist!” (tho’, I suppose, at that time, she had never heard a Methodist Preacher.)[7]","Tra cheayll yn pobble shen, deie ad magh, “Tee Methodist!”","[7] ‘(tho’, I suppose, at that time, she had never heard a Methodist Preacher.)’ — missing from the Manx translation."
"Both the man and his wife have been much persecuted, but they still continue very happy and lively.-","Ren yn Dooinney as yn Ven shoh surranse lane tranlaase, agh chum ad dy jeean[8] as dy maynrey ayns shirveish yn Chiarn.—","[8] dy jeean] earnestly, zealously."
