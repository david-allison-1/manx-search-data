"A GENTLEMAN was, some little time since, called upon to visit a dying female. He quickly obeyed the call: and entering the humble cottage where she dwelt, he heard, in an adjoining room, an infant voice.","Tra beg er dy henney, va Dooinney Seyr, currit fys er dy heet dy yeeaghyn Ben voght ching. Ren eh dy tappee gansoor; as tra v’eh er gholl stiagh ayns thie yn ven voght, ren eh clashtyn, ayns ayrn elley jeh’n thie, corraa lhiannoo. ",
"He listened, and found that it was the child of the poor dying woman engaged in prayer.","Ren eh geaishtagh, as hug eh my-ner dy reh lhiannoo yn ven ching va prayl. Va ayrn jeh’n phadjer echey myr shoh.[2]",[2] Va ayrn jeh’n phadjer echey myr shoh.]—' Part of his prayer went like this’
"“O Lord, bless my poor mother,” cried the little boy, “and prepare her to die. ","“O Hiarn, jean bannaghey my voir voght,” as jean ee ey yeddyn aarloo son baase.",
"O God, I thank thee that I have been sent to a Sunday-school, ","O Hiarn, ta mee cur booise dhyt dy row mee rieau currit dys schoill Doonnee,",
and there have been taught to read my Bible; and there I learn that ,"as ayns shen ynsit dy lhaih yn Vible, as ayns yn lioar shen ren mee gynsaghey",
"‘when my father and mother forsake me, thou wilt. take me up.’ ","‘Tra nee my Ayr as my Voir mee eh hreigeil, nee’n Chiarn mee eh ghoaill seose.’",
"This comforts me, now my poor mother is going to leave me. ","Ta shoh gerjagh dou, nish ta my Voir voght goll dy aagail mee.",
"May it comfort her, and may she go to heaven; and may I go there too! ","O dy vod ah ve gerjagh jees myrgeddyn, as dy j’hig ee roye dys Niau; as dy j’higyms gys shen neesht:",
"O Jesus, pity a poor child, and pity my poor dear mother; and help me to say, ‘thy will be done.’“","O Yeesey, jean goaill chymmey jeh lhiannoo boght, as jean goaill chymmey jeh my Voir voght, as cooin lhiam dy ghra, Cha nee my aigneys agh[3] ‘dt’aigneys dy row jeant","[3] Cha nee my aigneys agh] —‘It is not my will, but ..."
"He ceased, and the visiter opening the door, approached the bed-side of the poor woman. “Your child has been praying with you,” said he, “I have listened to his prayer.”","Eisht scuirr eh, as ren yn Dooinney seyr fosley yn dorrys, as hie eh stiagh[4], as hie eh ergerrey da lhiabbee yn Ven ching, as dooyrt eh, Ta’n lhiannoo eu er ve prayl meriu Ta mee er ve geaishtagh rish.",[4] as hie eh stiagh] ‘and he went in’
"“Yes,” said she, making an effort to rise, “he is a dear child.[5] Thank God, he has been sent to a Sunday-school:","Eisht dooyrt ish Ta, eh[6] er ve prayl marym, t’eshyn lhiannoo deyr dooys.

"I cannot read myself, but he can, and he has read the Bible to me; and I hope I have reason to bless God for it. Yea, I have learned from him that I am a sinner; I have heard from him of Jesus Christ, and I do, yes I do, as a poor sinner, put my trust in him.","Cha noddyms lhaih agh foddee eshyn as t’eh er lhaih yn Vible dou, as ta oyr aym dy voylley Jee son shen Ta mee er n’ynsaghey veihsyn dy vel mee drogh-yentagh, Ta mee er chlashtyn veihsyn jeh Creest Yeesey, as ta mee myr drogh yentagh coyrt my slane treishteil ayn.",
"I hope he will preserve me. I hope he has forgiven me. I am going to die; but I am not afaid: my dear child has, been the means of saving my soul. O! how thankful am I that he was sent to a Sunday-school.”","Ta mee treishteil dy jean eh sauail mee. Ta mee treishteil dy vel eh er leih dou.
