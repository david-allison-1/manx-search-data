Manx,English,Notes
"Honnick mee Ben y phoosee ayns e aalid as Moyrn,","I saw the young bride, in her beauty and pride,",
"Er ny coamrey ooilley ayns giall, ",Bedecked in her snowy array;,
"She eunys y teihll ren gerjaghey e cree, ",And the bright flush of mantled high on her cheek ,
"Va e vanrys cheet syragh ny whail,",And the future look’d blooming and gay:,
"Agh ren ee cur graih, da reddyn y teihll ","And with woman’s devotion she laid her fond heart,",
Ta chea myr yn druigh roish yn glorian[1] ,"At the shrine of idolatrous love,","[1] glorian—an unattested word, perhaps a diminutive form of gloyr—‘glory’? (Gloyr-yn-theihll—used by fisherman to avoid saying y ghrian—‘the sun’)."
"As yn chree eck va sniemmit lesh cordyn d’ardail, Cordail rish yn yearree eck hene, ","And she anchor’d her hopes to this perishing earth,",
,"By the chain which her tenderness wove,",
"Agh honnick mee ee reesht tra va ny coyrdyn shoh brisht,","But I saw when those heartstrings were bleeding and torn, ",
"Ayns seaghyn as trimsey v’ee shooyl,","And the chain had been sever’d in two,",
"Yn coamrey giall, ren ee leah y chaghlaa,","She had changed her white robes for the sables of grief,",
"As e aalid ren shymley ersooyl,",And her bloom for the paleness of wo!,
,,
"Agh yn fer-lhee va ayns shen, dy gergagh y cree, ","But the Healer was there, pouring balm on her heart,",
"As glenney dagh jeir veih e sooill,  ","And wiping the tears from her eyes,",
"As Sniemmee eh reesht, ny coyrdyn va brish, ","And he strengthen’d the chain he had broken in twain,",
"As deiyr eh e seaghyn ersooyl, ",And fasten’d it firm to the skies!,
"Agh cheayll ee corraa, va’n corraa shen dy hee, ","There had whisper’d a voice — ’twas the voice of her God,",
Neem’s oo y gherghaghey. Son ta mee Jee.,“I love thee—I love thee—pass under the rod!”,
"Agh honnick mee yn voir, lesh chemmey as graih, Jeeaghyn sheesh er yn lhiannoo sy chlean,",I saw the young mother in tenderness bend,
"Paagey e veillyn as gra, lesh gennalys cree,","O’er the couch of her slumbering boy,",
"Ta’n lhiannoo, yn lhannoo aym pene, ","And she kiss’d the soft lips as they murmur’d her name,",
,While the dreamer lay smiling in joy.,
Myr roseyn y voghrey er ny coodagh lesh druigh,"O, sweet as a rose-bud encircled with dew,",
"As yn viljid oc skeayley sy ayr,","When its fragrance is flung on the air,",
"Cha aalyn as bwaagh v’eh jeeaghyn da’n voyr, ","So fresh and so bright to that mother he seem’d,",
"Myr v’eh cadley dy souyr ass danjeyr, ",As he lay in his innocence there.,
"Agh honnick mee ee reesht tra v’ee jeeaghyn er shen,","But I saw when she gazed on the same lovely form,",
"V’eh cha treih as cha feayr ayns yn oaie, ","Pale as marble, and silent, and cold,",
"Agh ny s’feayr as ny s’trimshagh, v’an skeeal v’ee dy insh, ","But paler and colder her beautiful boy,",
"Son y lheid cha daink rieau urree roïe,",And the tale of her sorrow was told!,
,,
"Agh yn Fer-lhee va ayns shen, ren seaghyn nyn gree,","Bu the Healer was there who had stricken her heart,",
"Ren eh yn lhiannoo y ghoaill huggey hene, ","And taken her treasure away,",
"Dy hayrn ee dys shen, ghow eh yn lhiannoo dys Jee,",To allure her to Heaven he has placed it on high,
"Son yinnagh ee geiyrt er dys shen,","And the mourner will sweetly obey,",
"Agh Cheayll ee corraa, va’n corraa shen dy Hee, Neem’s oo y gerjaghey Son ta me Jee.","There had whisper’d a voice — ’twas the voice of her God,",
,“I love thee—I love thee—pass under the rod!”,
 ,"For such a thing never happened to her before,",
,"But the Healer was there, who troubled our hearts,",
,"He took the child to himself,",
,"To allure her there, he took the child to God,",
,"For she would follow him there,",
,"But she Heard a voice, that voice was of Peace,",
,I will console you For I am God.,
" Agh honnick mee neesht, tra v’n ayr as yn voir, ","I saw too, a father and mother who lean’d",
"Goaill boggey lesh gennalys cree, ","On the arms of a dear gifted son,",
"Tra va’d smooinaght er yn ghloyr, raad va’n","And the star in the future grew bright to their gaze, ",
"lhiannoo ersooyl, ",As they saw the proud place he had won;,
"Harragh adsyn Myrgeddin dys shen, ",,
"Grian fastyr yn vea ock, va tayrn dys yn sheear,","And the fast coming evening of life promis’d fair, And its pathway grew smooth to their feet,",
"As yn raad va gaase ashaagh dy hooyl, ","And the starlight of love glimmer’d bright at the end,",
"Yn rollage va leeideil ad, gaase foddey s’gloyroil, ",And the whispers of fancy were sweet.,
"Ayns maynrys veagh ad er yn shooyl, ",,
,,
"Agh honnick mee ad reesht, dy trimshagh jeeaghyn sheese,","And I saw them again, bending low o’er the grave, ",
"Syn oaie raad va’n callin[2] ec shee,","Where their hearts’ dearest hope had been laid,","[2] The original gives va’n cayllin (without initial lenition). Callin—‘a body’. Callin is said by Cregeen to be a feminine noun, and the corpus supports this. An alternative reading for cayllin might be caillin—‘a girl, or young woman’, but this is clearly not the intended meaning here. (Cregeen also assigns feminine grammatical gender to caillin, but the there is little supporting evidence for this in the corpus. The Irish and Scottish Gaelic equivalents to caillin; cailín and cailin are treated as gramatically masculine nouns.)"
"Yn rollage va leeideil ad, hie ayns dorraghys voue,","And the star had gone down in the darkness of night,",
As seaghyn ghow ghream er nyn gree. ,And the joy from their bosoms had fled.,
,,
"Agh yn Fer-lhee va ayns shen lane dy hymmey as graih,","But the Healer was there, and his arms were around,",
Yn Rollage ren ey y yeaghym daue reesht. ,And he led them with tenderest care: ,
V’ee soilshean foddey s’baaie ny honnick ad roie ,"And he show’d them a star in the bright upper world,,",
"V’ee leeideil ad dy graigagh dys Creest, ","’Twas their star shining brilliantly there!,",
As cheayll ad corraa va’n corraa shen dy hee ,"They had each heard a voice, ’twas the voice of their God,,",
Neem’s Shiu y yerjaghey Son ta mee Jee. ,“I love thee—I love thee—pass under the rod!”,
