"BEE Y SHEYOO Cohionnal Eddyrashoonagh jeh Studeyrys Celtiagh cummit ayns 1979 ayns Gaillimh, Nerin. Cha bee y cohionnal scanshoil shoh cummit ayns Mannin ayns 1979: ","THE SIXTH International Conference of Celtic Studies will be held in 1979 in Galway, Ireland. This important conference won’t be held in the Isle of Man in 1979: ",
Lhisagh shoh cur imnea er Manninee as lhisagh eh greinnaghey sleih dy chur er bun undinaght ennagh cour ard-ynsaght ayns Mannin.,This ought to be of concern to the Manx and it should encourage people to establish some foundation for higher education in the Isle of Man.,
      Ghow ny cohionnallyn eddyrashoonagh jeh Studeyrys Celitagh toshiaght ayns Divlyn 1959 as t’ad er ve cummit gagh kiare bleeanney neayrs y traa shen (cha nel kiangley oikoil erbee ayn eddyr cohionnallyn shoh ny scoillaryn as y Cohionnal Celtiagh ta cummit dy chooilley vlein).,"     The International Conferences of Celtic Studies began in Dublin in 1959 and they have been held every four years since that time (there is no official connection between these conferences, the scholars, and the Celtic Congress that is held every year).",
"Ayns 1953, 1967, 1971, as 1975, va cohionnallyn cummit ayns Cardydd, Dun Edin, Rennes as Penzance.","In 1953, 1967, 1971, and 1975, the conferences were held in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Rennes and Penzance.",
"Rere yn oardagh, lhisagh y sheyoo cohionnal ve cummit ayns Mannin, y cheyoo cheer Cheltiagh.","According to the order, the sixth conference should be held in the Isle of Man, the sixth Celtic country.",
"Agh y ving ad hoc ta reaghey craad vees y cohionnal cummit, s’liklee dy ren ish shaghney Mannin son 1979 er y fa nagh vel undinaght erbee ayns shen oddagh reaghey y cohionnal dy cummeydagh.","But the ad hoc committee that arrange where the conference will be held, it’s highly likely that they avoided the Isle of Man for 1979 because there isn’t any foundation at all there that could arrange the conference responsibly.",
"T’eh bunnys shickyr nagh beagh cohionnal 1975 er ve cummit ayns Penzance gyn Undinaght Studeyrys Cornagh y ve ayn neayrs 1971 ayns Redruth, y Corn.","It is almost certain that the 1975 conference wouldn’t have been held in Penzance without the Cornish Studies Foundation existing since 1971 in Redruth, Cornwall.",
"Myr shen, ta Mannin tannaght feer voal ayns Studeyrys Celtiagh, myr t’ee ayns cooishyn ynsee elley.","So, the Isle of Man remains very poor in Celtic Studies, as it is in other educational matters.",
     She cohionnal scanshoil y Cohionnal Eddyrashoonagh jeh Studeyrys Celtiagh.,     The International Conference of Celtic Studies is a very important conference.,
T’eh tayrn scoillaryn jeh goo mie voish ymmoddee cheeraghyn.,It attracts scholars of good reputation from many countries.,
"Ayns Penzance myleeaney va chaghteryn ayn voish ny Steatyn Unnaneyssit, yn Ungaar, yn Idaal, y Rank, y Velg, y Ghiarmaan, y Spaainney, Scandinavia chammah as adsyn voish Sostyn as ny cheeraghyn Celtiagh.","In Penzance this year there were representatives from the United States, Hungary, Italy, France, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Scandinavia, as well as those from England and the Celtic countries.",
Va’n Corn goltaghey mysh daa cheead chaghter as hug shen cooney as cree da’n Chorn hene. ,Cornwall was welcoming about two hundred representatives and that aided and encouraged Cornwall itself. ,
Dod lheid y chohionnal shoh skeayley magh fys dy mie.,Such a conference was able to disseminate knowledge well.,
"Va shoh baghtal ry akin er y fa dy dooar y mob beg dy Vanninee oardee son stoo bentyn rish y Ghaelg voish ollooscoillyn as scoillaryn ayns Paris, y Raue, Bonn, Stutgart, Uppsala, Ghent as Divlyn (haghyr shoh lesh feer veggan dy hoilsheydys as fegooish taishbynys-lioar kiart).","This was clear to see, because the little gang of Manx people got orders for material to do with Manx from universities and academics in Paris, Rome, Bonn, Stuttgart, Uppsala, Ghent and Dublin (this occurred with hardly any advertising and without a proper brochure).",
,,
     Foddee ve dy lhisagh Mannin jannoo arrish er y Chorn as dy lhisagh ee shirrey y shiaghtoo cohionnal y ve cummit ayns Mannin ayns 1983.,     It could be that the Isle of Man should copy Cornwall and it should ask for the sixth conference to be held in the Isle of Man in 1983. ,
Ta Mannin ayns feme jeh red ennagh goll rish yn Undinaght jeh Studeyrys Cornagh.,The Isle of Man is in need of something like the Foundation for Cornish Studies.,
Ta’n Undinaght shoh geddyn barrantys as argid voish Ollooscoill Exeter as Coonseil Chondae y Chorn ry cheilley.,This Foundation receives assurance and finance from the University of Exeter and the County Council of Cornwall together.,
Ta’n oollooscoill as y choonseil co-stiurey yn Undinaght.,The university and the council co-direct the Foundation.,
"She kiarail ny h-Undinaght “dy chur er y hoshiaght, dy cho-oardaghey, as dy chooney lesh dy chooilley horch sy studeyrys Cornagh — ta shen dy ghra, y studeyrys jeh sheelnaue sy cheer ynnydagh (y Corn as Ellanyn Scilly) sy traa hie shaghey, ec y traa t’ayn nish, as sy traa ry heet.”","It is the intention of the Foundation “to establish, to co-arrange and to assist with every sort of Cornish study — that is to say, the study of humanity in the local country (Cornwall and the Scilly Isles) in time(s) past, at the current time now, and in the future.”",
"     Fo kiannoortys e stiureyder vreeoil, yn Olloo Charles Thomas, fer Cornagh, ta reddyn er jeet lesh yn Undinaght.","     Under the governance of its energetic director, Professor Charles Thomas, a Cornishman, the foundation has been successful.",
"Ta e sleih-obbree goaill stiagh yn Olloo Thomas, un Ard-er Aa-hirrey, kiare Fir Aa-hirrey lane-emshyragh, un ’er Aa-hirrey Onnoragh as daa chleragh.","His workforce includes Professor Thomas, the Head Reasearcher, four full-time researchers, one Honorary Professor and two clerks.",
Ta lheead studeyrys ny h-Undinaght ry akin voish yn earishlioar eck hene.,The breadth of studies of the foundation is visible from its own journal.,
"Ayns yn earishlioar shoh, ta pabyryn bentyn rish ny shean[se]yn dooghyssagh, glare as fo-ghlare, as shennaghys sheshoil as shennaghys caggee.","In this journal there are papers concerning the natural sciences, language and dialect, and social history and war history.",
Sheeu toiggal nagh vel ollooscoill erbee sy Chorn hene she stashoon cheu-mooie jeh Ollooscoill Exeter yn Undinaght. ,"It’s worth realisng that there isn’t any university at all in Cornwall itself, the Foundation is a staion outside of Exeter University.",
"     Lhisagh Mannin ve abyl dy chur er bun Undinaght jeh Studeyrys Manninagh veagh geddyn ooilley e hargid voish Tynvaal, ny voish Tynvaal as ollooscoill ennagh ry-cheilley. ","     The Isle of Man ought to be able to establish a Foundation of Manx Studies that would be get all its funding from Tynwald, or from Tynwald and some university together. ",
"Gyn ourys, nee y chooid smoo dy Vanninee smooinaght dy chelleeragh er Ollooscoill Lerphoyll er y fa dy vel kianglaghyn ayn hannah eddyr Mannin as yn ard-valley Sostnagh shoh.","No doubt, most Manx people would think straight away of Liverpool University, because there are links already between the Isle of Man and this English city.",
"Agh veagh lheid y chiangley noa shoh gaueagh: ec y traa t’ayn, cha nel Studeyrys Celtiagh lajer ayns Ollooscoill Lerphoyll.","But such a connection such as this would be dangerous; at the current time, Celtic Studies is not strong enough in Liverpool University.",
"As ayns Undinaght jeh Studeyrys Manninagh veagh dooinney keeallagh geearree y studeyrys shoh y ve lajer, dy jarroo.","And in a Foundation for Manx Studies a reasonable man would want this field of study to be strong, definitely.",
"Er-lhiam dy bare dooin kiangley Undinaght Vanninagh lesh ollooscoill (ny ollooscoillyn) ayns Nerin, Nalbin, ny sy Thalloo Vertnagh.","I think it would be better for us to connect a Manx Foundation with a university (or universities) in Ireland, Scotland or in Wales.",
"Ec y chooid sloo, yinnagh y kiangley Celtiagh shoh foays da Manninee ta wheesh eeit seose lesh Sostnaghys.",At (the very) least this Celtic connection would benefit Manx people who are so much devoured by Englishness.,
"Erskyn ooilley veagh eh mie dy chiangley Undinaght Vanninagh lesh Ollooscoill ny Ben-rein, Beeal Feirshtey, lurg ooilley y boirey as caggey ayns Nerin.","Above all, it would be good to connect a Manx Foundation with Queen’s University, Belfast, after all the trouble and fighting in Ireland.",
"     Dy derragh Tynvaal argid cour Scoillarys Aa-hirrey tree bleeaney ayns Studeyrys Manninagh, veagh eh ny hoshiaght veg agh ny hoshiaght feeu. ","     If Tynwald would give money for a three year Research Scholarship in Manx Studies, it would be a small begining, but a worthy start.",
"Ec y traa t’ayn, veagh eh keeallagh dy chiangley lheid y scoillarys lesh Thie Tashtee Vannin. ","At the current time, it would be sensible to tie such scholarship in with the Manx Museum. ",
"Agh y red smoo scanshoil, shen dy chur er bun Undinaght jeh Studeyrys Manninagh.","But the most important thing, that is to establish a Foundation of Manx Studies.",
