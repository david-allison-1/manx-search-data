Manx,English,Notes
YN SHIAGHTIN shoh chaie va mee ayns Lunnin er cooishyn (nagh agglagh yn boayl shen eh!)[1] as va mee troailt er yn Fo-halloo gys yn Aerphurt ec Heathrow. ,Last week I was in London on matters (isn’t that place awful!) and I was travelling on the Underground to the Airport at Heathrow. ,[1] nagh agglagh yn boayl shen eh!] — [nagh vel yn boayl shen agglagh!] expected here.
V’eh orrym dy chaghlaa traenyn ec Hammersmith as va mee farkiaght dy gholl trooid yn chleigh-scarree tiggadoil tra haink dooinney hym as ghow eh toshiaght taggloo rhym ass y Yernish.,I had to change trains at Hammersmith and I was waiting to go through the ticket-wicket / ticket barrier when I man came to me and he started talking to me in Irish.,
Va shen er y fa dy row mee fainey er my chooat y cheau.,"That was because I was wearing a fainey (‘ring’ – a gold ring lapel badge used to identify a fluent Manx speaker, as used in Ireland by Irish speakers) on my coat.",
"     S’treih lhiam nagh vel Yernish dy liooar aym dy cho-loayrt rish ass y Yernish, agh loayr mee rish ass y Ghaelg Vanninagh as hoig eh mee mie dy liooar.","     I regret that I don’t know enough Irish to converse with him in Irish, but I spoke in Manx Gaelic and he understood me well enough.",
"     Agh ny lurg, ghow mee toshiaght smooinaghtyn er y thaghyrtys shoh.","      But after, I started thinking about this event.",
"Hoshiaght, nagh lhisagh shin ceau fainey anchasley reeish [ta] ec ny Yernee?","First, shouldn’t we wear a different fainey to what the Irish have?",
Foddee dy voddagh shin jannoo ymmyd jeh fainey as ny tree cassyn cheu sthie.,Maybe we could use a fainey (ring) with three legs inside.,
"     Dy jarroo, foddee dy bee eh eie mie my yeanys shin loayrt as cordail rish ny Gaelgeyryn Yernagh as Albinagh my-chione fainey noa cadjin son ymmyd jeh dagh ooilley Gaelgeyr lesh cowrey er-lheh urree dy hiolshaghey my ta’n ceaudeyr ny Yernagh, Albinagh ny Vanninagh.","     Indeed, maybe it will be a good idea if we speak and agree with the Irish and Scottish Gaelic speakers about a new ordinary fainey (ring) for use of every Gaelic speaker with a special sign on it to show if the wearer is an Irish person, a Scot or Manx person.",
Eisht cha beagh marran erbee ayn.,Then there wouldn’t be any mistake.,
"     Nah, smooinee mee dy row yn Ghaelg Albinagh gaase ny smoo faase, as cha nel yn Ghaelg ainyn cho lajer as by vie lhien noadyr. ","     Next, I thought that Scottish Gaelic is growing more weak, and our Gaelic isn’t as strong as we would like either. ",
Ta’n Yernish yn un vanglane dy Ghaelg ta foast lajer as toiggit dy lhean. ,Irish is the one branch of Gaelic that is still strong and widely understood. ,
"Myr shen foddee nagh lhisagh shin cur fainey airhey da fer erbee mannagh vel Gaelg Vanninagh mie echey, as myrgeddin, Gaelg Yernagh fondagh.","So maybe we ought not give any gold ring to anyone unless he has good Manx Gaelic, and also, sufficient Irish Gaelic.",
"     Lhig dooin aa-chooinaghtyn “Cooidjagh shassoo, scarrit tuittym.” As ta ny Gaeljee ooilley yn un phobble.","     Let’s rememember “Together standing, divided falling.” And the Gaels are all the same people.",
