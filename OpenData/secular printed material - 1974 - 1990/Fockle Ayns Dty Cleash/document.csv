Manx,English,Notes
KEGEESH er dy henney va mee ayns ny h-Ellanyn Ammyr jannoo cooish.,A fortnight ago I was in the Channel Islands for a meeting.,
"V’eh orrym chellvaney yn oik aym ayns Mannin, as tra va’n chellvane freggyrit, she carrey aym v’ayn as Gailck echey.","I had to phone my office in the Isle of Man, and when the telephone was answered, it was a friend of mine who knows Manx.",
Dy chelleeragh as gyn smooinaghtyn ghow shin toshiaght dy loayrt ass y Ghailck.,"Straight away, and without thinking, we started to speak in Manx.",
"Nish, ec y traa v’ayn va mee my hoie ny mastey sleih ayns Oik Chadjin, as foddee ad my choraa y clashtyn[1].","Now, at that time I was seated amongst people in a General Office, and they could hear my voice.",[1] y chlashtyn] original gives [y clashtyn]
"Cha row fys oc er yn ghlare assjee va mee loayrt, as va yindys mooar orroo tra hooar ad magh.","They didn’t know about the language in which I was speaking, and they were greatly amazed when they found out.",
"Cha nel mee er n’akin whilleen dy volleeyn goll seose as sheese![2] Ansherbee, ta fys oc nish dy vel yn Ghailck bio!"," I have never seen so many eyebrows going up and down! Anyway, they know now that Manx is alive!","[2] Cha nel mee er n’akin whilleen dy volleeyn goll seose as sheese!] Evidently the intended meaning is ‘I have never seen so many eyebrows going up and down’, for which we woud expect; [Cha vaik mee rieau whilleen mollee goll seose neose]."
Tra va mee ayns shen chionnee mee maclioar yn phabyr-naight “Guernsey Evening Express”.,When I was there I bought a copy of the newspaper “Guernsey Evening Express”.,
Va’n kione-linney gra “Myn-Immeeaght jeh cummaltee gys Ellan Vannin.”,There was a headline saying “small departure of residents to the Isle of Man.”,
"Dooyrt yn colloo dy vel, ec y chooid sloo, shey cummaltee berchagh er n’aagail guernsey son yn ellan ain.","The column said that, at least, six wealthy residents had left Guernsey for our island.",
"Ta ny oyryn dy vod ad creck ny thieyn oc ayns ny h-Ellanyn Ammyr son leagh ard[3], as son leagh[4] ny s’injilley, thieyn ayns Mannin y chionnaghey.","The reasons are that they can sell their houses in the Channel Islands for a high price and, for a lower price, buy houses in the Isle of Man.","[3] leagh ard] ‘high price’. See also [ardleagh]. 
[4] ‘Leagh’ ‘reward’, or ‘recompense’, but evidently used here  for ‘Price’. See also [prise], [prios], [price], [feeagh].
"
"Lesh yn argid spaar[5], foddee ad bishaghey nyn jeet-stiagh dy streeu rish feeaghyn irree[6]. ","With the spare money, they can increase their income to struggle against rising prices. ","[5] spaar] ‘spare’. 
[6] feeaghyn irree] [feeaghyn girree] would be expected here (the ‘g’ of the verbal noun ‘girree’ is usually treated as integral). "
"Dy mennick, ta feallagh briagh orrym dy hoilshaghey magh yn aght ta’n fockle Baarlagh “for” chandaait ayns y Ghailck.","Often, folk ask me to explain the way the English word ‘for’ is translated into Manx.",
Ta ymmoddee fockleyn son “for” ayns y Ghailck.,There are many words for ‘for’ in Manx.,
"T’ad shoh goaill stiagh son, da, ry-hoi, cour, car, rish, as kuse dy ’ir elley[7].","These include ‘son’ (‘for’), ‘da’ (‘to’, ‘for’), ‘ry-hoi’ (‘for the purpose of’) ‘cour’ (‘for), ‘car’ (‘for the duration of’), rish (‘for’ a specific length of time), ‘fo’, ‘ry-hoi’, and a few other ones.",[7] kuse dy ’ir elley] ‘some other (additional) ones’ —  [feallagh elley] in Classical Manx would be expected here.  [feallagh] in the twentieth century came to be used for ‘folk’ whereas in Classical Manx it usually means ’ones’ — in Classical Manx [paart elley] is used for ‘other (additional) ones (people)’.
"“Son shee[8], ta mee er gionnaghey[9] gleashtan da my ven, ry-hoi my ven.","“For peace, I have bought a car for my wife, for my wife.","[8] son shee] ‘for peace’ — (the more usual way to express ‘for‘ in this example is [er graih ‘for the sake of‘. Common abstract nouns such as [y vea] ‘life’, [y vaase] ‘y vaase’, [y ghraih] ‘love’ are usually accompanied by the article. See also [er graih yn shee] ‘for the sake of peace’.
[9] er gionnaghey] [er chionnaghey] ‘have bought’"
T’eh cour troailtagh er laa fliaghee.,It’s for traveling on a rainy day.,
"T’eh er ve eck car bleeaney, agh er yn oyr dy vel eh brisht, cha nel ee er n’yannoo ymmyd jeh rish tree meeghyn.”[10]","She’s had it for a year, but because it is broken, she hasn’t made use of it for three months.”",[10] meeaghyn] ‘months’. Original gives [meeghyn].
"Cha nel yn skeeal shoh firrinagh, ta shiu toiggal, er yn oyr dy vel mee ro voght dy chionnaghey gleashtan, agh t’eh ny hampleyr jeh’n aght dy chur Ghailck er “for”.","This story isn’t true, you understand, because I am too poor to buy a car, but it is an example of the way to give the Manx for ‘for’.",
"Dy jarroo, ta’n Rollage Vanninagh son, as da, as ry-hoi yn Ellan! As dy bishee ny lhaihderyn eck!","Indeed, the Manx Star is for (in favour of, in support of), for (produced for), ry-hoi (for the purpose of) the Island! And may her readers prosper!",
