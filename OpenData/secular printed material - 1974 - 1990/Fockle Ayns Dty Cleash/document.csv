Manx,English,Notes
KUSE DY LAGHYN er dy henney va mee loayrt rish Adrian y Phirgrim mychione yn feme mooar t’ain er tooilley lettyraght.,A few days ago I was talking to Adrian Pilgrim about the freat need we have for more literature.,
"Ta fys eu nagh vel monney lettyraght ayns y Ghaelg Vanninagh, er lhimmey jeh lioaryn-crauee as lioar veg ny ghaa dy skeeallyn giarey.","You know there isn’t much literature in Manx Gaelic, except for religious books and a book or two of short stories.",
"Chammah as ny lioaryn ta clouit, ta obbraghyn elley screeuit ayns y Ghaelg foddee ve er ny gheddyn ny keayrtyn, agh cha nel[1] monney jeu t’ayn as t'ad ooilley maclioaryn fotografagh ny aa-hoyllit liorish Roneo[2].","As well as the books that are printed, there are other works in Manx that can be found sometimes, but not there aren’t many of them and they are all photographic copies or duplicated by Roneo.",
"Nish, cha nel shin ooilley nyn soie er nyn dhoynyn. ","Now, we aren’t all sitting on our butts. ",
"Ta fys aym dy vel Breean mac Stoyll screeu lioar far-skeeallagh noa, as dy vel Adrian y Phirgrin myrgeddin screeu obbraghyn noa dy lettyraght.","I know that Brian Stowell is writing a new fictional book, and that Adrian Pilgrim is also writing new works of literature.",
"Agh t’eh jeeaghyn dooys dy vel ooilley yn lettyraght shoh ro hrome, myr yien, as ta feme ain dy chur magh lettyraght eddrym ennagh.","But it seems to me that all this literature is too heavy, as it were, and we need to publish some light literature.",
"Atreih, cha nee bunneydagh yn aigney aym, as er y fa shen cha noddym veg y yannoo agh chyndaa lioaryn Baarlagh ny Frangagh ayns y Ghaelg.","Alas, my mind isn’t ‘original’, and therefore I can’t do anything except translate English or French books in Manx.",
"Ta mee er n'goaill toshiaght lesh yn startey shoh hannah, as ec my hie ta maclioar fer jeh ny lioaryn ec Georges Simenon ta goll er chyndaa, as ec yn oik aym ta fer elley. Er ny n'jees jeu ta mee gobbraghey, beggan ry veggan, as foddee bee'm er chur kione er 'nane jeu leah dy liooar.","I have begun with this job already, and at my house is a copy of one of Georges Simenon’s books that is being translated, and at my office there is another. On the two of them I am working, little by little, and maybe I will have finished one of them soon enough.",
"Er-lhiam dy by vie Ihiu Ihaih ayrn yn obbyr aym. Myr shen, er hoh diu beggan. T'eh toshiaght ""Yn Chied Chooish ec Maigret""","I think I would you would like to read part of my work. So, here for you is a little bit. It is the beginning of “Maigret’s First Case”.",
“Va skelfyn doo rheynney yn shamyr ayns daa ayrn. ,“A black railing divided the room in two.,
"Ayns yn ayrn cummit da yn theay, cha row agh un vink gyn-dreeym, daahit doo myrgeddin, noi boalley bane-slaait, as er ny chooadaghey lesh foghryn oikal.","In the part reserved for the public there was only one backless bench, also painted black, against a whitewashed wall covered with official notices.",
"Er y cheu elley, va koiyr-screeuee, lesh tobbyryn-doo, tuill-colmane lhieenit lesh fillaghyn thummidagh as adsyn doo myrgeddin. Myr shen va dagh ooilley nhee doo as bane.","On the other side were some desks, with inkstands, pigeon-holes filled with bulky files, which were black too, so that everything was black and white.",
"Va'n red smoo cronnal, ny hassoo er brelleein dy veain, coirrey-shamyr dy yiarn-leieit, yn lhied nagh vel ry-akin jiu agh ayns stashoonyn bayr-yiarn baljyn beggey, lesh cuisle ren drappal hoshiaght seose lesh yn 'ar-voalley, agh lurg shen loobey mygeayrt, goll dy lane tessyn y chamyr roish my skell eh ayns y voalley.","The most conspicuous thing, standing on a sheet of metal, was a cast-iron stove, the sort only to be seen nowadays in small town railway stations, with a pipe which first climbed up towards the ceiling, then bent round, going right across the room before it disappeared in the wall.",
,,
"Cheu-mooie, va shee ny h-oie dy neu-vennick er ny vrishey liorish feiyr dy rockadyn.”","Outside, the peace of the night was infrequently broken by the noise of rockets, ",
"Myr shen, she blass jeh shen ry-heet shoh.","So, this is a taste of that to come.",
