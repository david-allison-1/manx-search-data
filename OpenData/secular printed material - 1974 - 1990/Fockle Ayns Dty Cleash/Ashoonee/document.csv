"S’mie lhinyn dy mennick smooinaghtyn orrin-hene myr ashoonee jeh’n ashoon Vanninagh. Ta shin shieltyn dy vel nyn ashoon ny h-ashoon er-lheh, dy bollagh anchasley rish ny Sostnee, as eer anchasley rish ashoonyn nyn vir-mooinjerey Gaelgagh. ","We like to often think of ourselves as nationalisits of the Manx nation. We suppose that our nation is a special nation, completely different to the English, and even different to the nations of our Gaelic relatives. ",
"Dy jarroo, ga dy re beg shin, she ashoon er-lheh shin, goaill nyn ynnyd mastey ashoonyn yn theihil.","Indeed, although we are small, we are a separate nation, taking our place amongst the nations of the world.",
"Blein ny ghaa er-dy-henney, tra va Reihys Cadjin goll er cummal ayns y Reeriaght Unnaneysit, va mee jeeaghyn er Ludowic Kennedy er y chellveeish, as eshyn taggloo mychione ny Sheshaght Ashoonagh Albinagh (S.A.A.).","A year or two ago, when there was a General Election being held in the United Kingdom, I was watching Ludowic Kennedy on the television, and he was talking about the Scottish National Party (SNP).",
"V’eh gra dy vodmayd cur enney er ashoon voish tree nheeghyn. Hoshiaght, ta shennaghys er-lheh echey; nah, ta cultoor er lheh echey, as trass, t’echey chengey er-lheh.","He was saying that we can recognise a country from three things. First, it has a separate history; second, it has a separate culture, and third, it has a separate tongue.",
"Fy yerrey, by vian lhiam cur nhee elley. Ta mee credjal dy n’egin da ashoonee jeh ashoon gennaghtyn spyrryd-ashoonagh ayns nyn greeaghyn as soilshaghey magh yn voyrn ashoonagh oc trooid jallooghyn dy ’eniee, troggallyn stoamey, moir-agglishyn aalin, abbyr raad ta oanluckit kirp ny Reeghyn as treanee oc. ec dagh ooilley ashoon ta brattaghyn er-lheh, sidooryn jesh-chliaghtagh, kiaull ashoonagh ooasle.","Finally, I would wish to give another thing. I believe that nationalisits of a nation must feel a national spirit in their hearts and explain their national pride through images (statues?) of heroes, grand buildings, beautiful cathedrals, that will say where are buried the bodies of their kings and heroes. Every nation has its individual flag, ceremonial soldiers, noble national music.",
"     Dy jarroo t'eh myr by vian lesh sleih yn ashoon dy chur, ayns aght so-akin as so-chlastyn, prow dy vel yn ashoon oc ny h-ashoon ooasle as moyrnagh. As mannagh chreidys oo mee, gow gys Lunnin, ny Paris, ny Washington as jeeagh. ","     Indeed, it is as if the people of the nation would wish to give, in an easily visible and audible way, proof that their nation is a noble and proud nation. And if you don’t believe me, go to London, or Paris, or Washington and look. ",
"As ayns aght ny s'fastee, fowee shiu yn red keddin ayns Divlin, ny Doon Edjin. Ayns ny ard-valjyn ooilley shoh, cha noddys ve ourys ec peiagh erbee dy re kione-valjyn t'ad ec ashoonyn moyrney.","And in a more descreet way, you will find the same thing in Dublin, or Edinburgh. In all these cities, no one can have any can doubt that they are catpitals of proud nations.",
"     Ayns Mannin, myr dooyrt mee roie, ta shin smooinaghtyn orrin-hene myr ashoon beg agh er-lheh. ","     In the Isle of Man, as I said before, we think of ourselves as a small but independent nation. ",
"Ta shennaghys er-lheh ainyn, as cultoor as chengey myrgeddin, gyn scansh da ooilley ny eabbyn ec ny Sostnee barbaragh sleih-marroo as ny Quislingyn Manninagh oc dy stroie shin as dy ghoaill er-sooyl nyn eiraght.","We have a separate history, and a culture and tongue too, without importance for all the efforts of the barbarous English dead people and their Manx Quislings to destroy us and to take away our inheritence.",
"     Myr shen s'cair dooin dy lhisagh ve ainyn jallooghyn, troggallyn as myr shen dy chur shin ayns cooinaghtyn jeh ny treanee as feniee ainyn.","     So it is right for us that we should have images, buildings and so on to remind us of our heroes and champions.",
"Atreih; ayns y cheead-blein s’jerree, tra va pooar ny Sostnee ooilley-niartal, va cheet-stiagh yn Reiltys Vannin ayns laueyn ny Sostnee, as eer er son ny killag Noo Ean noa[1]  va troggit, v'eh er Tynvaal dy ghuee er ny Sostnee son yn vooadys veg dy argid va ymmyrchagh dy aa-hroggal yn shenn chabbal va ayns shen roie.","Unfortunately, in the last hundred years, when the power of the English was almighty, the income of the Manx Government was in the hands of the English, and even for the new Saint John’s church that was built, Tynwald had to beseech the English for the small bulk of money that was necessary to rebuild the old chapel that was there before.",[1] er son ny killagh Noo Ean noa] ‘for the new church of Saint John’. [er son ny killagh] ‘for the church’ here is a calque on Scottish Gaelic {airson na h-eaglais}. The expected phrase would be [son Keeill Eoin noa].
"Myr eiyrtys er shoh, cha row un troggal ny carnane ashoonagh er ny hroggal.","As a consquence of this, not one national building or monument was built.",
Cha row veg lowit agh jallooghyn da Reeghyn as Mraane-Rein Sostnee.,There was nothing allowed but pictures of English Kings and Queens.,
"As chammah as eh shoh, ga dy ren ny Sostnee coamrey Cashtal Rushen dy mie myr pryssoon, haink yn Abb Rushen dy ve ny gharey da ny skibbyltee-boghtey, raad oddagh ad daunsin lesh faghid er oaieghyn Reeghyn Vannin. Jiu, ta nyn ashoon g'aa-chouyral e voyrn. Ta shin ny h-ellynyn Sostnagh y yiooldey. ","And as well as this, although the English dressed Castle Rushen well as a prison, Rushen Abbey became a garden for the tourists, where they could cance with mockery on the graves of the Kings of Mann. Today, our nation is recovering its pride. We are rejecting the English manners. ",
"As ayns y voyrn ashoonagh noa ainyn, ta feme ainyn er jallooghyn, troggallyn as yn chullee dy ashoonaght.","And in our new national pride, we need images, buildings and the apparatus of nationality.",
"Dy ghoaill toshiaght, myr shen, lhig dou cur rhymbiu kuse dy eieghyn.","To begin, then, let us put before us some ideas.",
"Ta feme ain er jallooghyn dy ’eniee as treanee ayns buill baghtal ayns Doolish; feniee gollrish Ree Gorree I, Aspick Simon, Illiam Dhone, Aspick Wilson, A. W. Moore, as ymmoddee deiney as mraane elley.","We need images of chapions and heros in conspicuous places in Douglas, champions similar to King Orry I, Bishop Simon, Illiam Dhone, Bishop Wilson, A. W. Moore, and many other men and women.",
Ta feme ain er moir-agglish noa. By vian lhiam cur rhymbiu dy lhisagh shin yn chabbal ec Balley Cheeill Ean y aa-hroggal dy ve ny moir-agglish ashoonagh noa dooin.,"We need a new cathedral, I would wish to put before you that we should rebuild the chappal at St Johns to be a new national cathedral for us.",
"Lhisagh ny Sostnee ve er nyn n'imman voish Abb Rushen, yn aght foddee eh cheet dy ve rullick da nyn dreanee, as boayl cummit casherick rish yn chennaghys ain.","The English should be driven from Rushen Abbey, the way it may be come to be a graveyard for our heroes, and place kept holy to our history.",
"Agh er-skynn ooilley ta feme ain dy ynsaghey da nyn baitchyn ny nheeghyn mychione yn chennaghys ain-hene, ny feniee ain-hene, ayns ymmyd jeh ny reddyn Sostnagh.","But above all we need to teach our children the things bout our history, our own champions, instead of English things.",
"Lhisagh shin smooinaghtyn orrin-hene, as ynsaghey da nyn baitchyn, dy ve Manninee as Europee.","We should think of  ourselves, and teach to our children, to be Manx people and Europeans.",
"Ta’n ashoon ainyn Mannin, myr ashoon mastey ny fir elley ayns Europ. Shegin dooin baghey myr shen, as soilshaghey magh da'n theihll dy vel eh myr shen.","Our nation is Mann, as a nation amongst the other ones in Europe. We must live like that, and explain to the world that it is like that.",
