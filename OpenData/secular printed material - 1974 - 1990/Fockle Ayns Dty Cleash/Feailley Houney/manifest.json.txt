This piece is accredited to Iseabail Ni Mheic Cailéin daughter of Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll, circa 1500, and is found in The Book of the Dean of Lismore — a collection of Gaelic poetry from Ireland, Scotland and perhaps the Isle of Man. The book uses a unique orthography, (not closely related to any Manx orthography). No reliable online translation has been found for this poem.
