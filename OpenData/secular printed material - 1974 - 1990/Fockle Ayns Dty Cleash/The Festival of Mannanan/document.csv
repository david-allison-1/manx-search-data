"Tra screeu mee yn colloo yn shiaghtin shoh chaie, v’eh roish my row ny Flahee (the Chieftans) er jeet gys nyn ellan. ","When I was writing the column last week, it was before the Chieftans had come to our Island. ",
Agh she shickyr mish [sic] dy row yn chooid smoo jeh lhaihdeyryn yn cholloo shoh ec yn chuirrey-chiall jeant oc Jeheiney yn shiaghtin shoh chaie.,But I am sure that most of the readers of this column were at the concert performed by them on Friday of last week.,
"Va fys aym dy row sheean yn phossan shoh ny heean yindyssagh, as by haittin lhiam dy mooar dy ’akin ooilley yn sleih ta sheiltyn yn red keddin.","I knew that the sound of this group was a wonderful sound, and it was a great pleasure for me to see all the people who imagine (think) the same thing.",
"      Ta shin nish smooinaghtyn er yn ’eailley yn blein cheet[1] [sic]. Ta mee credjal dy vel possan-kiaullee elley ayns yn Erin ayn, as foddee dy yarg[2] ad cheet, enmyssit Sianan.","     We are now thinking about the coming year’s festival. I believe that there is another music group in Ireland, and maybe they can come, called Sianan.","[1] yn ’eailley yn blein cheet] — [feailley yn vlein çheet] ‘the coming year’s festival’.
[2] yarg] original gives [yargys]"
As ta possan ayn ayns yn Albin enmyssit “Guillyn yn Logh”.  ,And there is a group in Scotland called “The Boys of the Loch”.,
"Ta shin smooinaghtyn neesht er Leon Rowsome kiaulleyder ny piobyn uillin, my-e-chione va mee screeu yn shiaghtin shoh chaie. ","We are thinking too about Leon Rowsome, an uillin pipes musician, about whom I was writing last week. ",
"Fy yerrey, smooinee shin dy beagh eh eie mie dy chuirrey yn phoib-heshagh as daunseyryn voish yn “Freiceadan Dhubh”, ny, ayns nyn nGaelg, yn Arrey Doo aynsyn cheau mee daa vlein ymmoddee bleantyn er-dy-henney tra ren mee yn Chirveish Ashoonagh aym.","Finally, we thought that it would be a good idea to invite the pipe society and dancers from the “Freiceadan Dhubh”, or, in our Manx “The Black Watch”, within which I spent two years many years ago, when I did my National Service.",
"      My ta eieghyn erbee ec peiagh erbee, my sailliu cur fys hym, ny gys Chalse y Guard.","     If anyone has any ideas, if you please, let me or Charles Guard know.",
"     Er cor erbee, stroo-hene dy row yn cuirrey-kiaull jeant ec ny Flahee (ny ny Toshiee) speeideilys mooar as bee failt orroo ayns Ellan Vannin traa erbee s’mie lhieu cheet reesht.","     In any way, it appears to me that the concert performed by the Princes (or, na Taoisigh) [The Chieftans] was a great success and they will be welcomed in the Isle of Man any time they like to come again.",
     Yn kione-shiaghtin shoh chaie va daa ghooinney ayns Mannin voish Radio Chellveeish Erin.,     Last weekend there were two men in the Isle of Man from Raidió Teilifís Éireann.,
"Va ’nane jeu enmyssit Donncha O Dulaing, as v’ad jannoo claare mychione ny feailley Vananan, ayns yn Ellan dy bollagh.","One of them was called Donncha O Dulaing, and they were making a program about the Festival of Mannanan, completely in the Island.",
"Ta Donncha jannoo claare dagh laa quieg minnidyn lurg three ayns yn ’astyr, as ta ennym yn claare “Three On One”.","Donncha does a program every day, five past three in the afternoon, and the name of the program is “Three on One.”",
Va mee g’eaishtagh rish Jelune shoh chaie as v’eh loayrt mychione Mannin.,I was listening to it last Monday and he was talking about the Isle of Man.,
Er-lhiam dy bee eh taggloo ny s’odjey yn shiaghtin shoh cheet.,I think he will be talking longer next week.,
"T’eh simmoil dy ’akin RTE chur aa-insheydeyryn gys yn ’eailley Vananan traa nagh row fer ry-akin voish Radio Vannin, ny’n B.B.C.","It is interesting to see RTE sending reporters to the Festival of Mannanan when no one was to be seen from Manx Radio, or the B.B.C.",
"Myr ta fys eu, ta mee credjal dy lhisagh yn Erin as Mannin g’aase ny sniessey re-chielley as s’mie eh dy ’akin ny Yernee goaill simm ayndooin.","As you know, I believe that Ireland and the Isle of Man should grow together and it is good to see the Irish taking interest in us.",
,,
"     Dy chur jerrey er yn cholloo shoh, ta mee credjal dy voddym aa-chooinaghtyn dy dooyrt yn Reiltys Vanninagh dy beagh ad cur ayns gleashaght Manninagh ayns ymmyd jeh ny fir Sostnagh.","     To finish this column, I believe that I can remember that the Manx Government said that they would be putting in a Manx movement {??} instead of the English ones.",
Cha nel mee er n’ghoaill tastey foast jeh veg. Foddee dy row shen gial elley ta er ve er ny vrishey. ,I haven’t noticed anything yet. Maybe that was another promise that has been broken.,
