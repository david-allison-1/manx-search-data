Manx,English,Notes
"GAGH blein, ayns gagh brastyl ny Gaelgey, bee ny h-ynseydee s’toigallee cur feyshtyn ennagh da’n ’er-ynsee ver da shoh [sic] pian ’sy chione. ","Evey year, in each Manx class, the most knowledgeable students will put some questions to the teacher that will give this (person) a pain in the head. ",
Myr sambyl “ta shiuish er n-ynsaghey dooin y raa ‘rouyr dy leih’ agh ayns lioar shoh ta shin feddyn ‘rouyr sleih’; quoi jeu shoh ta kiart?”,"As a sample, “you have taught us the phrase ‘rouyr dy leih’ (‘too many people’) but in this book we see ‘rouyr sleih’ (‘too many people’)’ which of these is correct?”",
Cre ’sy Theihll nee yn fer-ynsee boght freggyrt lurg da feysht y lheid goll er cur da?,What in the World will the poor teacher answer after such a question being put to him?,
"Foddee dy vreggyr eh dy vel ny n’yees jeu [1]kiart, as nagh vel anchasleys erbee ayn eddyr oc; ny dy vel yn derrey yeh jeant ymmyd jeh ’sy Ghaelg noa-emshiragh, ny foddee ’sy Ghaelg lettyragh, as dy vel jeh  elley er ny gheddyn ’sy Ghaelg jeh’n cheead-blein shoh chaie (ny foddee ’sy Ghaelg choloayrtssagh). ","Maybe he will answer that the two of them are both correct, and that there isn’t any difference at all between them; or that the first one is used in modern Manx, or maybe in literary Manx, and that the other one is found in the Manx of this past century (or maybe in conversational Manx).  ","[1] ny n’yees jeu] see also [ad ny-neesht], [yn jees jeu], [yn jees oc]."
"Aghterbee, cre erbee vees e ’reggyrt, s’cosoyllagh eh nagh bee yn fer-ynsee hene slane maynrey lesh y chooish as dy gow eh arrys dy nee fer-ynsee ny Gaelgey eh!","Anyway, whatever his answer will be, it is likely that the teacher himself won’t be fully happy with the subject and he will regret that he is a teacher of Manx!",
Ta shoh taghyrt dy mennick — dy jarroo ro vennick — er yn oyr nagh vel ardchoonseil hengagh ayn dy reaghey yn sorch dy Ghaelg lhisagh shin gynsaghey ayns nyn mrastyllyn. ,"This happens often — indeed, too often — because there isn’t a ‘high-council of language’ to arrange the sort of Manx we should learn in our classes. ",
"“Cre?” jir paart jiu lesh meechredjue, “Ard-choonseil hengagh, Slane dyn ymmyd!, Cre’n feme t’ain er y lheid?”","“What?” Some of you will say with disbelief, “A High-Council of Language, Completely useless! What need do we have for such a thing?”",
Foddee dy der eh yindys er mooarane sleih clashtyn nagh vel yn eie shoh noa ny neuchadjin ayns cheeraghyn elley er chor erbee.,Maybe it will surprise at lot of people to hear that this idea isn’t at all new or unusual in other countries.,
"Ta ard­choonseil hengagh ec ny Hewnyn, ny Daneyn, eer ec ny Free see as mooarane dy phobbylyn elley ocsyn ta chengey nagh vel agh kuse veg dy leih loayrt.","The Jews, the Danes, and even the Frisians have a  ‘high-council of language’ / ‘language academy’, and many other peoples with a language that only a few people speak.",
"As ta ny h-ardchoonseilyn shoh reaghey y fockley, feyshtyn chengagh, Cummaghyn-fockle ouryssagh, t’ad cur stiagh fockleyn as raaghyn noa son nheeghyn as eieghyn noa-emshiragh, as t’ad reaghey un chummey jeh’n ghlare vees ry-ynsaghey da paitchyn ayns ny scoillyn.","And these acadamies arrange the word, language questions, doubtful word-forms, they put in new words and phrases for modern things and ideas, and they arrange one form of the language that will be to be taught to children in the schools.",
"Rish tammylt braew nish ta’n Ghaelg er choayl e raad ’sy theihll shoh wass, as dauesyn ta geearee screeu (ny loayrt) ’sy Gaelg mychione cooishyn nagh vel bentyn rish yn yeeastagh, yn eirinys, ny ny greaseyn thieoil, ta doilleeidyn dy-liooar cheet nyn guaayl dy jarroo, choud’s shoh t’eh er ve er un dooinney ynrican, Doolish y Karagher, ughtar fockleyr noa ny Gaelgey, dy gheddyn aghtyn cooie dy loayrt mychione nheeghyn noa-emshiragh ayns Gaelg Ellan Vannin.","For a fine while now Manx has lost its way in this world, and for those who desire to write (or speak) in Manx about matters that don’t concern fishing, farming, or the domestic industries, there are enough difficulties coming their way indeed, thus far it has been the down to only one man, Douglas Faragher, author of the new Manx dictionary, to find suitable ways to talk about modern things in the Isle of Man’s Gaelic.",
"As nee peiagh erbee as fys echey er y chooish insh diu dy re startey foayragh eh shoh — yiarrins, startey nagh lhisagh shin jerkal rish un dooinney dy yannoo nagh vod ceau agh ayrn jeh'n traa echey er.","And any person who knows about this matter will tell you that this is a beneficial job — I would say, a job we should not expect one man to do, who can only spend some of his time on it.",
"Ny sodjey, eer [sic] my t’eshyn freggyrtagh rish cur stiagh ’sy Ghlare fockleyn as raaghyn noa, cuin as cre’n aght hed ooilley ’n obbyr elley er cooilleeney oddagh ardchoonseil hengagh goaill ayns laue (ta shen dy ’ra, ny h-obbraghyn er ny imraa heose). ","Furthermore, even if he is responsible for putting new words and phrases into Manx, when and how will all the other work be achieved that a language academy should undertake (that is to say, the works mentioned above).
