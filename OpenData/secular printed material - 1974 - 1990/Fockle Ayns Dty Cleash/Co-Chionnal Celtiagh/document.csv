CO-CHIONNAL CELTIAGH SY CHERNOW,A Celtic Conference in Cornwall,
YN chiaghtyn elley hie Breean Mac Stoyll as mish hene lesh shilley er Penzance sy Chernow dy goaill ayrn er y Cho-chionnal Cheltiagh va goll er cummal ayns shen. ,The other week Brian Stowell and myself went to see Penzance in Cornwall to take part in the Celtic Congress that was being held there. ,
She Co-chionnal ny Schoilleyryn v’ayn as cheayll shin leeaghtyn (lectures) er nyn lhaih magh liorish ollooyn as ollooscoillyn veih cheeraghyn Celtiagh. ,It was a congress of scholars and we heard lectures read out by professors from universities from Celtic countries. ,
"Ny lurg shen hie shin er thurrysyn mygeart ny cheerey gys buill myr Kioncheery (Lands End) as Cronk Noo Mayl (St. Michael's Mount), as oie Jerdein ghow shin ooilley ayrn er shirveish va cummit sy Chornish gyn fockle erbee edyr sy Vaarle. ","After that we went on excursions around the country to places like Lands End and St Michael’s Mount, and on Saturday night we all took part in a service that was held in Cornish without a single word in English.",
Er yn oie yerrinagh hie shin dys jinnair mooar y cho-chionnal as ghow shin soylley jeh dy mooar.,In the final night we went to the big dinner of the congress and we enjoyed it greatly.,
"She cliaghtey lesh ny schoilleyryn lheid y cho-chionnal y reaghey ayns ollooschoil, agh yn keart shoh chaie, ga dy row eh er ny reaghey liorish Schoill Studeyryssyn ny Kernow v’eh ny chummal ayns bailey gollrish Rhumsaa feer foddey veih Exeter, yn ollooschoill sniessey, as haink eh dy ve feer speeideilagh.","     To arrange such a conference is a custom with the scholars, but the last time, although it had been arranged by The School of Cornish studies, it was held in a town like Ramsey very far from Exeter, the closest university, and it became very successful.",
She ec yn cho-chionnal shoh haink ard-schoilleyryn ny glaraghyn Celtiagh ry cheilley dy resooney magh yn boayl son cummal yn nah cho-chionnal ayns 1979.,It is at this congress that chief scholars of the Celtic languages came together to discuss the location for holding the next next congress in 1979.,
" (She dagh kerroo blein t’eh goll er cummal) as smooinee ad dy dowin er Mannin myr boayl jeantagh y co-chionnal y chummal ayn, agh ga dy re shayll Vannin bee ayn y lheid y reaghey yn nah cheayrt, rosh ad y covriwnys dy re ayns Galway bee yn nah cho-chionnal er yn oyr nagh-vel undinys (institution) erbee ayns Mannin gollrish y lheid ayns y Chernow as reaghys y cho-chionnal y chur fo-laue echey, as dooyrt ad by beagh eh femoil lheid yn undinys y chur er bun roish my noddagh ad smooinaght er cummal y co-chionnal ayns Mannin. "," (It is held each quarter) and they seriously considered the Isle of Man as a possible place to hold the congress, but although it is the Isle of Man’s turn to arrange such the next time, they reached the decision that the next conference will be in Galway because there is no institution in the Isle of Man like such as in Cornwall to take on the organising of the conference, and they said that it would be necessary to establish such a institution before they could think about holding the conference in the Isle of Man. ",
Dooyrt ad dy beagh ad coontey jeh Mannin myr boayl cooie yn nah cheayrt sy vlein 1979.,They said they would be an account of the Isle of Man as a suitable place of the next time in the year 1979.,
"As yn red shoh ayns nyn aignaghyn nish, dy beagh shin geearee y co-chionnal cheet gys Mannin — son gyn ourys erbee she ooashley mooar da Mannin veagh ayn y co-chionnal shoh y chummal as y reaghey syn Elian — shegin dooin goaill toshiaght er smooinaghtyn ec y traa t’ayn as prowal dy choyrlaghey as dy chleayriaghey reiltys Vannin er ny vondeishyn mooarey sorch dy undinys son Studeyryssyn Manninagh y chur er cosh. ","With this thing in our minds now, if we were wanting the conference coming to the Isle of Man  — because no doubt at all it would be a great honour to the Isle of Man to hold and organise this conference in the Island — we must start thinking at the present time and investigate to advice and to [??] the Isle of Man Government about the great benefits to establish a sort of foundation for Manx Studies.",
"Vaare er shen, er yn oyr re lhied ny schoillyn t’ayns Nalbin, Nherin, Bretyn sy Vritaan, as sy Chernow obbyr y yannoo car y traa er ny glaraghyn ocsyn hene, ta feme ain er y lheid, son ta ram obbyr foast er mayrn ry yannoo er Studeyryssyn Manninagh, as ga dy re ram obbyr feer vie v’er ny jannoo hannah er reddyn Manninagh, er lhiams dy chordagh dagh ooilley ghooinney dy beagh eh foddey ny share gobbraghey car y traa er Studeyryssyn Vannin ayns boayl er lheh currit er bun er son yn oyr shoh.","In addition, for the reason that there are such schools existing in Scotland, Ireland, Wales, in Brittany and in Cornwall to do work all the time on their own languages, we need such, for there is a lot of work left to do on Manx Studies, and although it is much very good work that had been done already on Manx things, I think that every man would agree that it would be far better working all the time on Manx Studies in a separate place established for this reason.",
