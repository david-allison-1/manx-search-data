TA THREE nheeghyn ayn yn shiaghtin shoh my-nyn-gione by vie lhiam insh diu.,There are three things this week about which I would like to tell you.,
 Haink ny nheeghyn ooilley voish yn Phabyr-naight Sostynagh “Yn Emshir Jedoonee”.,The things all came from the English newspaper “The Sunday Times”.,
"Ayns Yn Ellan Skianagh[1], faggys da’n voayl my-e-chione va mee screeu yn chiaghtin shoh chaie, ta ard-scoill[2] noa er ve currit er bun cour ny nGaelgeyryn, as she yn chied ard-scoill Gaelgagh eh ayns yn Albin rish ymmoddee lhingyn.","In Skye, near to the place about which I was writing last week, a new college has been established for the Gaelic speakers, and it is the first Gaelic college in Scotland for ages. ","[1] Yn Ellan Skianagh] ‘Wing Island’ — ‘The Isle of Skye’. Original gives [Ellan Skianagh].
[2] ard-scoill] Sabhal Mòr Ostaig was established as a college of further education. In the twenty-first century [ard-scoill] or [ardscoill] is more commonly used for ‘high school’."
"Screeu Ian Noble, ny ’er toshee ayns y Ghleashaght shoh, rish Sir Alexander MacDonald, Caarliagh jeh Distillers Company, shirrey argid jeh yn cheshaght shen da’n ard-scoill noa.","Ian Noble[3], a leader in this Movement, wrote to Sir Alexander MacDonald, Chairman of The Distillers Company, asking for money from that organisation for the new college.","[3] Ian Noble (1935-2010) was a businessman and landowner who founded Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in 1973, and established businesses in Skye that sought to hire Gaelic speakers. Noble founded The Gaelic Whiskies company in 1976. The Distillers Company was taken over by Guiness & Co. in 1986."
"Dreggyr Sir Alex (dy baghtal ta sheeanane Verchagh Hosnagh echey) ayns y Vaarle, dy row sym mooar oc er sonnys as speeideilys ny Skiannee.","Sir Alex answered (clearly, he has a Wealthy English accent) in English, that they had a great interest in the prosperity and success of the Skye people.",
"Agh ‘ayns yn sheiltynys aym pene as ec ny co-stiureydeyryn aym, cha bee yn traa-ry-heet da ny h’ellanyn er nyn gooney liorish gleashagh erbee as t’eh foee greinnaghey aa-vioghys yn chengey Ghaelgagh.","But ‘in my own estimation, and that of my co-directors, the future for the islands will not be helped by any movement that intends to encourage the revival of the Gaelic tongue.",
Ta mee credjal dy vel fys ec sleih dy cadjin dy duitt yn foays jeh ynsagh da’n phobble Yernagh dy mooar tra va eie gollrish shoh er ny choyrt er toshiaght ayns shen.”,I believe that people generally know that that the benefit of education for the Irish people fell greatly when an idea like this was progressed there.”,
     Cha lhiass dou gra dy vel corree erskyn towse ec ny Gaelgeyryn Albinagh as Yernagh son yn sampleyr shoh jeh sonaase almoragh Sosnagh.,     I need not say that Scottish and Irish Gaelic speakers have incredible anger  for this example of ignorant English haughtiness.,
"Myr shen, ta dagh ooilley Ghaelgeyr gobbal dy chionnaghey cooidyn erbee jeant ec Distillers Company, goaill stiagh nyn Ustey-Bio (Haig, Black and White, Johnny Walker, as fir elley.)","So, every Gaelic speaker is refusing to buy any goods made by The Distillers Company, including their whisky (Haig, Black and White, Johnny Walker, and other ones.)",
"Ayns Canada, ta ny Frangee ayns Quebec er reaghey dy nee Frangish yn glare scoill. ","In Canada, the French in Quebec have arranged that French is the school language.",
As ta leighyn noa er ve jeant oc dy choyrt er ny Baarleyryn sonaasagh dy choyrt biallys da’n leigh shoh.,And new laws have been made by them to make the haughty English speakers obey this law.,
As ta shen yn aght lhisagh eh ve. Agh s’yindyssagh yn aght eh dy vel ny Baarleyryn screeagh.,And that is the way it should be. But how wonderful is the way that English speakers scream.,
 Dy bishee yn ’rangish ayns Quebec!,May French flourish in Quebec!,
"As fy yerrey, va mee smooinaghtyn my-chione Sheshaght Pobblaght ny h’Erin, ga nagh voddym jannoo lesh ny dunveryn co-chadjin[4] ayns Ullee[5], cha mie lhiam ny share ny dunveryn Prostaanagh.[6]","And finally, I was thinking about the Irish Republican Army, although I cannot do with the Catholic murderers in Ulster, I don’t like the Protestant murderers better.","[4] [co-chadjin] ‘universal’, ‘catholic’, not usually applied to the religious use of ‘catholic’, for which [catholic], [Catoleagh] or [Romanagh] would be expected.
[5] [Ullee] ‘Ulster’. Original gives [yn Ullee].
[6] [Prostaanagh] ‘Protestant’, 
"
"Ny yeih, tra ta ooilley er ve raait, cha nel yn derrey yeh ny yn jeh elley er n’yannoo skielley dooin foast er y fa dy vel shin er reayl shin-hene er cheumooie[7] jeh’n streppal oc.","Nevertheless, when all has been said, neither one nor the other have done harm to us yet because we have kept ourselves outside of their struggle.",[7] er cheumooie] – [cheumooie] ‘outside’
Ta mee boirit nish dy der Sosnee orrin dy ghoaill yn cheu oc.,I am worried now that the English will make us take their side.,
Ta fys aym dy shickyr dy darragh boiranys hooin feer tappee dy jinnagh shin eh shen. ,I certainly know that agitation will come to us very fast if we do that. ,
"As neesht, ta ram sleih ayns yn ellan as goghe ad yn cheu elley noi ny Sostnee.","And also, there are many people in the island that would take the other side, against the English.",
 Shegin dooin freayl er y cheumooie jeh caggaghyn Sosnagh., We must keep on the outside of English wars.,
