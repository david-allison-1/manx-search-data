Manx,English,Notes
"EC CANT liorish Braaraghyn Chrystal ayns Rhumsaa er-y-gherrit, chionnee mee shiartanse dy lioaryn, lioaranyn as duillagyn, goaill stiagh “Juan Doo, Shiaulter”.","At an auction by Chrystal Brothers in Ramsey recently, I bought several books, booklets and pages, including “Juan Doo, Shiaulter” (“Black John, Sailor”). ",
"S’foddey neayr’s lhaih mee yn skeeal shoh, as cha row monney Gaelg aym ec y traa shen. ","It’s a long time since I read this story, and I didn’t know much Manx at that time. ",
"Dy jarroo va mee strepey lesh yn chengey ayns ny laghyn shen, as shirrey dagh nah ’ockle ayns my ’ockleyr. ","In fact, I was struggling with the language in those days, and searching every other word in my dictionary. ",
"Aghterbee, lhaih mee yn lioar reesht as va yindys orrym fakin yn Gaelg aalin aynjee. ","Anyway, I read the book again and I was amazed to see the beautiful Manx in it. ",
Ta’n aght jeh screeu cho flaoil as berchagh dy by chair jee ve er ny aachlou cho leah as foddee.,The way of writing is so fluent and rich that it rightfully should be reprinted as soon as possible.,
"     Dy jarroo, tra scuir mee dy smooinaghtyn er, shimmey skeealyn t’ayn by chair daue ve er nyn aachlou as aa-chur magh. ","     Indeed, when I stopped to think about it, many are the stories that should be reprinted and re-issued. ",
"Foddee lhisagh yn nah chur-magh ec yn cheshaght ve ny lioar skeeaylyn, goaill stiagh ymmoddee skeeaylyn beggey voish ooilley ny ymmoddee lioaranyn as duillagyn ta er ve currit magh ayns ny bleeanyn ’er n’gholl shaghey.","Maybe the society’s second edition should be a book of stories, including many little stories from all the many booklets and pages that have been published in the years that have gone by.",
"      As nish red ennagh dy bollagh anchasley. Nish dy vel yn Ghaelg aavioaghey ayns nyn ellan, as ta tooilley sleih goaill toshiaght gynsaghey yn Ghaelg, ta ram dooilleeidyn troggal nyn ging.","     And now something completely different. Now that Manx is reviving in our island, and there are more people starting to learn Manx, there are many difficulties ‘lifting our heads’.",
"Ta’n laad-obbree er geayltyn fir-oik ny sheshaght ro hrome daue. (Er y fa shen, ta feme ain er cooney voish yn Reiltys).","The workload that is on the shoulders of officers of the society is too heavy for them. (Therefore, we have a need for help from the Government).",
"As ta feme ain dy yannoo ymmyd smoo jeh’n ghlare ayns nyn vea gagh laa. Agh, harrish ooilley, shegin dooin ve kiarailagh gyn dy cur er ny Sostnee, ny Baarleyryn Manninagh, gennaghtyn er nyn maggyrt. ","And we need to make more use of the language in our lives every day. But, above all, we must be careful not to make the English, or English speaking Manx people, feel threatened. ",
"Choud as ta shin shooyl er nyn doshiagh, shegin dooin lieh-lhie er-nyn-gooyl lesh ny Baarleyryn.","Whilst we are walking ahead, we must lean backwards towards the English speakers.",
"Ny slooid dy jeanmayd shoh, irree noidys mastey ny Baarleyryn as vees shen sie da’n ghleashaght.","Unless we do this, enmity will arise amongst English speakers and that will be bad for the movement.",
"      Myr shen ga dy n’egin dooin cummal creoie as lajer er nyn raad, shegin dooin dy kinjagh cooinaghtyn dy vel ellynyn-mie yn aght share dy chosney creeaghyn.","     So, although we must keep hard and strong on our way, we must always remember that good-manners is the best way to win hearts.",
"Shegin dooin dy nyn n’greinnaghey dy heet dy ve cliaghtit rish sheean ny Gaelg, as dy hoaighey jee myr red dooghyssagh.","We must encourage them to become used to the sound of Manx, and to accept it as a natural thing.",
"Foddee ny lurg shen gowee ad toshiagh ymmyd y yannoo jeh kuse dy ’ockleyn, as raaghyn Gaelgagh derrey hig yn traa bee ad jannoo ymmyd jeh focklyn Gaelgagh ny shlee na fockleyn Baarlagh.",Maybe after that they will begin to use a few Manx words and phrases until the time will come (when) they will be using Manx words more than English words.,
"      Tra va mee baghey ayns Ar-Africkey, va’n ghlare ec yn chooid smoo d’Europeeanee mestit lesh Baarle as Swahili as eer beggan dy Afrikaans! ","     When I was living in East Africa, the language of the majority of Europeans was mixed with English and Swahili and even a little Afrikaans! ",
"She raad moal caghlaa yn ghlare ec pobble, as shegin da’n phobble ve arryltagh.","Changing the language of people is a slow way (road), and the people must be willing.",
"     Ta mee er screeu dy liooar. Caisht ghennal erriu. Ny Jarrood nyn jirveish er 13 Jerrey Arree, ec Keeill Noo Tomaase, Doolish.","     I have written enough. A cheerful Easter to you. Don’t forget our service on the 13th of April, at St Thomas’, Douglas.",
