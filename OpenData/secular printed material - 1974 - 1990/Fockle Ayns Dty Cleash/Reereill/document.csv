Manx,English,Notes
"Car bleantyn jeianagh, ta’n eie jeh reereill er ve er ny ’eyshtey lesh jeeanid bishaghey.","Throughout recent years, the idea of monarchy has been questioned with increasing ardour.",
"Dy chliaghtagh[1], ta Mannin ny reeriaght, agh choayl[2] shin yn ree ain daa cheead bleeaney er-dy-henney, as eer ec y traa v’ayn she Sostnagh va’n ree.","Traditionally, the Isle of Man is a monarchy, but we lost our king two hundred years ago, and even at that time the King was an Englishman.","[1] Dy chliaghtagh] ‘Dy cliaghtagh’ (lention here in error) — Seems to have been used to translate ‘traditionally’.
[2] Choayl] ‘lost’ (past tense of [coayl]. See also;[chaill]. "
"Ec y traa t’ayn, ta’n ven-rein ain myrgeddin ben-rein Hostyn[3] as ymmoddee cheeraghyn elley ayns y teihll Hostnagh.","At the present time, our queen is also the Queen of England and many other countries in the English world.",[3] original gives; ta’n ven-ren ain myrgeddin ny ben-rein Hostyn] ‘our queen is also a queen of England’.  
"Agh, ayns yn aght ta ny kianglaghyn lesh Sostyn goll er feayshley, s’liass dooin briaght jin-hene my s’feeu[4] red erbee[5] lhien[6] yn reereill.","But, in the way that the connections with England are being loosened, we need to ask ourselves if the monarchy is worth anything to us.","[4] my s’feeu] When ‘if’ occurs between two phrases the expected method of translation would not require [my] but would use a dependent verb form to carry the meaning of ‘if’, eg; [... vel yn reereill feeu red erbee dooin] ‘... if (the) monarchy is worth anything to us’.
[5] red erbee] original omits [red]
[6] lhien] ‘with us’ the prepositional pronoun that usually partners ‘s’feeu’ here would be ‘dooin’; ‘... my s’feeu dooin ...’ — ‘... if it is worth us ...’.

" Dy beagh Mannin slane seyr, myr by vie lesh ymmoddee jin, verragh shin dy dooghyssagh cheb er jannoo ny share ny cooishyn eddyr ain-hene as ny deiney mooinjerey ain ayns yn Erin as yn Albin[7].","If the Isle of Man were to be completely independent, as many of us would like, we would naturally attempt to make matters between ourselves and the kinsmen we have in Ireland and Scotland.","[7] yn Erin as yn Albin] ‘Nerin as Nalbin’ — ‘Ireland’ and ‘Scotland’. (J. J. Kneen popularised [yn Erin] and [yn Albin] in ‘Simple Lessons in Manx’ (a series in the Isle of Man Examiner, circa 1900) and ‘The Herald Manx Lesson’ (a series in Mona’s Herald, circa 1935)."
"Ta’n Erin, er lhimmey da’n fooillagh coloinoil[8] as askaid ayns Ulaidh[9], ny poblaght hannah.","Ireland, except for the colonial remains and bile in Ulster, is a republic already.","[8] coloinoil] — ‘colonial’, see also; [coloinagh].
[9] Ulaidh] ‘Ulster’ (Irish spelling). The Manx spelling is usually [Ullee]."
"My yiowys ny h’Albinee nyn seyrsnys[10] as ta shoh jeeaghyn feer chosoylagh[11] ec y traa t’ayn, cha jean yn reereill tannaghtyn rish foddey.","If the Scottish acquire their freedom, and this looks very probable at the present time, the monarchy won’t remain for long.","[10] seyrsnys] ‘independence’ — favoured by nationalist political writers of the late 20th C over [reamys] ‘freedom’.
[11] cosoylagh] ‘compare, or liken’, often preferred to [liklee] for translating ‘likely’, or ‘probable’ by writers of the late 20th C.

"As mannagh bee reeriaght ayn ayns yn Albin chammah as yn Erin, cre’n oyr shegin dooin eh y ’reayll?","And if there won’t be a monarchy in Scotland as well as Ireland, why must we preserve it?",
"Shegin dou gra, roish my jedym ny s’odjey, dy vel mee jannoo soiaght[12] jeh’n lught thie reeoil Sosnagh, as ta mee credjal dy vel ad nyn sleih yindyssagh.","I have to say, before I go further, that I respect the English royal family, and I believe that they are wonderful people.",[12] soiaghey] original gives [soiaght]
" Agh ta ram sleih yindyssagh ayns y teihll, as cha nel shen resoon dy liooar dy ’reayl yn reereill. ","But there are many wonderful people in the world, and that is not reason enough to maintain the monarchy. ",
Shegin da ve feme ny share ain na shen.,We must have a better need than that.,
Verrin argane rhymbiu dy vel reereill rheynnit lesh Sostyn ny ghaue beayn da’n teyrsnys ain.,I would put the argument before you that a monarchy shared with England is an eternal danger to our freedom.,
"T’eh gobbraghey noi nyn moyrn ashoonagh, yn aght t’eh coyrt reddyn Sosnagh harrish reddyn Manninagh.","It works against our national pride, the way it puts English things over Manx things.",
(Quoi eshyn as fys echey er yn ree s’jerree Hostyn[13] as Gailck echey?) , (Who knows who the last king of England was who knew Manx?) ,[13] ree s’jerree Hostyn] ‘the last king of England’. Original gives [yn ree s’jerree Hostyn].
She lhiettrimys[14] eh ayns raad ny h’ordailys noa jeh ny ashoonyn Europeanagh dy by vie lesh whilleen jin fakin.,It is an obstacle in the way of the new order of the European nations that so many of us would like to see.,"[14] lhiettrimys] ‘hindrance’ — In Classical Manx [cumrail]. [lhiettrimys] usually means ‘distinction, distinguishment, difference, or discrimination’, but in late 20th C Manx it is sometimes found with the meaning ‘hindrance’, or ‘obstacle’. "
Ta shin nyn Manninee as nyn Europee. Cre’n feme t’ain er ree ny ben-rein Hostyn?,We are Manx people and Europeans. What need do we have for a king or queen of England?,
