S’giare yn colloo yn chiaghtin shoh! ,How short this week’s column is! ,
"Ta mee er ve feer hrong er-y-gherrid, as myr shen cha nel caa er ve aym dy smooinaghtyn mysh ny baillym gra.","I have been very busy recently, and so I haven’t had an opportunity to think about what I would like to say.",
"     Foddee dy by gooin shiu ren mee[1] screeu yn shiaghtin shoh chaie mychione coamraghey ny deiney er Cronk Keeill Eoin, as ny idd-ardey faghidagh er!","     Maybe you would remember (that) I wrote last week about the clothing of the men on Tynwald Hill, and the ridiculous top hats on them!","[1] Foddee dy by gooin shiu ren mee screeu] — [Foddee dy gooinagh shiu dy ren mee screeu] ‘Maybe you’d remember that I wrote’, or [Foddee dy bee oo cooinaghtyn dy ren mee screeu] ‘maybe you’ll remember that I wrote’ expected here."
"My-ta, laa ny ghaa ny lurg, hooar mee yllagh-chellvane voish Cleragh Barrantee Valley-chashtal as dooyrt eh rhym dy row ny deiney er Cronk Keeill Eoin jeeaghyn gollrish fir-oanluckee as dy row feme orrin cur beggan dy chullyr yenydagh stiagh ayns y yesh-chliaghtey. ","Though, a day or two after I got a phonecall from the Castletown Clerk of Commissioners, and he said to me that the men on Tynwald Hill were looking like undertakers and that they needed to put a little bit of {??} colour into the ceremony. ",
"Va shin loayrt mychione cloagaghyn ayns breckan-Manninagh ry-cheau ec Caarliee ny Barrantee Baljagh, lesh freeney-chrammanyd as er cowraghyn jeh ny baljyn er lheh.","We were talking about cloaks in Manx tartan to be worn by the Chairs of the Town Commissioners, with a buttoned pin (broach) with signs of the individual towns.",
"     Ny keayrtyn, tra ta mee goll mygeart ny hellan ta mee fakin enmyn thie ass y Ghaelg.","     Sometimes, when I am going around the Island I see a house name in Manx.",
"Agh cho mennick as t’ad er nyn screeu dy kiart, t’ad er nyn screeu dy neu-chiart. ","But as often as they are written correctly, they are written incorrectly.",
Son sampleyr honnick mee yn chowrey “Thie ny cronk”.,"For example, I saw the sign “Thie ny Cronk”. ",
Atreih! Lhisagh eh er ve “Thie yn chruink”.,Alas! It should have been “Thie yn chruink”.,
S’mian lhiam dy jinnagh feallagh ad kiart!,I wish ones (folk) would do them right!,
"Agh, er lhiam, my foddee[2] yn reiltys jannoo marran “Freayll yn ellan glen,” cha lhisin rouyr y accan, agh lhig dooin ooilley cheb y chur er karraghey[3] drogh-Ghaelg traa-erbee fowmayd ee[4]. ","But, I think, if the government can make in error; “Keeping the Island clean,” [instead of “Keep the Island clean”], I shouldn’t complain too much, but let’s all make an effort to mend bad Manx anytime we find it.
