"VA MEE ec Tynvaal er yn queigoo Jerrey Souree, as ghow mee soylley jeh dy mooar.","I WAS at Tynwald on the fifth of July, and I enjoyed it greatly.",
"Agh ren mee [goaill] tastey dy row anchaslys mooar ayn eddyr ocsyn va soie er yn chronk, as ocsyn va nyn shassoo, ny shooyl mygeayrt fo yn chronk.","But I noticed that there was a great difference between those who were sitting on the hill, and those who were standing, or walking around under the hill.",
"Er y chronk va’n sheeloghe ny shinney, lesh shenn eieghyn lieh-Sostnagh, as ceau coamrahgyn quaaagh as joarree.","On the hill there was the older generation, with old half-English ideas, wearing strange and foreign clothes.",
"Ayns ynnyd jeh idd ardey as cooatyn, lhisagh ad ceau yn filley-beg, jeant ass breckan Vanninagh.","Instead of top hats and coats, they should wear the kilt, made out of Manx Tartan.",
Veagh yn filley-beg[1] ny s’jeshey da Manninee na idd ardey as cooatyn moghrey!,The kilt would be nicer for Manx people than top hats and morning coats!,"[1] Filley beg] elsewhere ‘fillee beg’, from Scottish Gaelic ‘fèileadh beag’, English; ‘fillibeg’ / ‘philibeg’."
"Fo yn chronk va’n sheeloghe ny s’aa [sic], shiartanse jeu loayrt ass y Ghailck, as adsyn ooilley lesh moyrn as graih ayns nyn greeghyn er yn ashoon as cheer oc. ","Under the hill was the younger generation, several of them speaking in Manx, and all of them with pride and love in their hearts for their nation and country. ",
"Hig yn traa[;] bee yn sheeloghe ny s’aa jiu [sic], soie er yn chronk. ",The time will come; the younger generation of today will be sitting on the hill. ,
"Derrey yn traa shen, cha noddym agh aaloayrt yn shenn raa, “cha nel shenn gheiney ny eieghyn oc rieau y chaghlaa; t’ad geddyn baase!”","Until that time, I can only restate the old saying, “old men never change their minds; they die!”",
As nish son red ennagh dy bollagh anchasley!,And now for something completely different!,
"Ta ram fockleyn ayns nyn nGhailck son yn fockle Baarlagh “child”, oikan, pohniar, scollag, lhiannoo, stuggey, as paitchey.","There are many words in our Gaelic for the English word ‘child’; infant, young child, older child, child, young teen, and child.",
Ta “paitchey” ny ’ockle chadjin.,‘Paitchey’ is a general word.,
"Tra ta paitchey ruggit, t’eh ny “oikan”.","When a child is born, he’s an ‘infant’.",

"Ta’n bun ec “lhiannoo” lieh-noo, er yn oyr dy row sleih sheiltyn dy vel paitchyn gollrish nooghyn beggey.","The origin of the word ‘lhiannoo’ is half-saint, because people were supposing that children are like little saints.",
"Er son my ven, cha noddym cordail ree!","As for my wife, I can’t agree with her!",
"Ta kiare mec aym (tree phoniaryn, as un scollag), as ny-keayrtyn t’ad ny smoo gollrish lieh-jouylyn na lieh-nooghyn!","I have four sons (three young children and one older child), and sometimes they are more like half-devils that half-saints!",
