Ta fys ain nish nagh vel ny Prostanee aarloo dy ghellal lesh nyn go-Yernee Co-chadjin[2] er-lhimmey myr beishtyn ny s’injilley.,We know now that the Protestants aren’t ready to deal with their fellow Irish except as lower beasts.,"[2] go-Yernee Co-chadjin] evidently ‘Catholic fellow Irish (people)’, or similar, is intended here."
Ta ny Prostanee foast beaghey ayns y chiaght cheadoo jeig.,The Protestants still live in the seventh century.,
As ta ny Goaldee as ny Yernee ayns Divlin gaase ny smoo neu-hurransagh as ny smoo skee roo.,And the British and the Irish in Dublin are growing more impatient and more tired of them.,
"Cre, eisht, fodmayd jerkal ayns meeghyn re-heet. Gyn ourys, brishee yn Co-haglym Bun-reiltagh sheese ayns corvaal.","What, then, can we expect in future months. No doubt, the Constitutional Conference will break up in disarray.",
"Cha nod ny sheshaghtyn politicagh cordail roo-hene, tra, t'ad goaill toshiaght liorish gra nagh vel ad aarloo[3] dy lhiasaghey nyn eieghyn ayns aght erbee.","The political parties cannot agree with each other, when, they begin by saying they aren’t prepared to develop their ideas in any way.",[3] nagh vel ad aarloo] original gives [nagh vod ad aarlooit].
"My, eisht, vees yn Co-hagglym co-huittym, cre taghyr[4] ny lurg ? Cha nod reiltys jeeragh tannaghtyn son dy bragh. ","If, then, the Assembly collapses, what will happen after? Direct rule cannot remain for ever. ",[4] cre taghyr] cre haghyrys
Cha surree ny Sostnee nyn sidooryn dy gholl er maroo son dy bragh.,The English won’t suffer their soldiers to be killed forever.,
"Cha der ny Yernee Co-chadjin seose ny ashlishyn oc dy aa-unaneys son dy bragh, as Mannagh bee ny Co-chadjinee er nyn n’yannoo magh, gowee ny bleaystyn toshiaght reesht.","The Catholic Irish won’t give up their visions of reunification forever, and unless the Catholics are satisfied, the explosions will start again.",
"Agh mannagh bee ny Prostanee er nyn n’yannoo magh, shirree ad seyrsnys.","But unless the Protestants are satisfied, they will seek independence. ",
"     Lhig dooin sheiltyn, eisht, myr ta jeeaghyn cosoyllagh, my hirrys ny Prostanee seyrsnys, ghowys[5] ny Co-chadjinee toshiaght ceau bleaystyn, as reaghys ny Sostnee dy hayrn magh.","     Let’s imagine, then, as seems likely, if the Protestants seek independence, (if) the Catholics begin throwing bombs, and (if) the English will arrange to draw out (‘withdraw’?).",[5] ghowys] — [yiow] expected here.
"Brishee caggey magh. As e ry fa dy vel Prostanee ny s'lhee na ny Co-chadjinee, bee eh er Phobblaght ny h-Erin red ennagh y yannoo.","War will break out. And because Protestants are more in number than Catholics, the Republic of Ireland will have to do something.",
As cha shass yn Pobblaght as jeeagh er ny Co-chadjinee goll er marroo.,And the Rupblic won’t stand and watch the Catholics being killed. ,
"Myr shen, ny s'leah ny ny s’anmee, ta mee jerkal rish lane-chaggey as craght.","So, sooner or later, I expect full war and destruction.",
"As er lhiam cossynee ny Co-chadjinee yn varriaght, er y fa dy vel sheshaght-chaggee 'heer-chliaghtagh as reaghit ayns y Phobblaght.","And I think the Catholics will be victorious, because there is a trained (?) and organised army in the Reupublic.",
"Ta mee credjal, lurg da chaggey atchimagh, nagh bee agh daa chounty er mayrn ec ny Prostanee, ta shen dy ghra, Co. Antrim, as Co. Down. ","I believe, after a terrible war, the Protestants will only have two counties left, that is to say, Co. Antrim, as Co. Down. ",
"As ta mee credjal dy n'egin da ram sleih gleashey voish nyn dhieyn, as dy bee ram kemmyrkee ayn.","And I believe many people will have to move from their houses, and that there will be many refugees.",
"Cre cho agglagh ny smooinaghtyn shoh! Lhig dooin ooilley jerkal, as padjer y ghoaill nagh daghyr eh shoh. ","How awful these thoughts are! Let us all hope[6], and pray, that this will not happen. ","[6] jerkal] ‘expecting’, sometimes used for ‘hoping’ instead of [treishteil]."
"Er yn oyr, my haghyrys eh, cha bee Mannin faagit ny lomarcan, as bee traaghyn smoo doillee as seaghney ainyn ooilley.","Because, if it happens, the Isle of Man won’t be left alone, and we will all have more difficult and troubling times.",
