Manx,English,Notes
YN CHIAGHTIN shoh chaie va mee jeeaghyn er claare chellveeish mychione ben enmyssit Candice Bergen.,Last week I was watching a television programme about a woman called Candice Bergen.,
     T’ee ny fillym-rollage Americagh as neesht screeudeyr da earishlioar ny ghaa.,     She’s an American film star and also a writer for a magazine or two.,
"     V’ee gra dy row ee er ve ec giense ayns y Europ, as dy row ayns shen ram sleih as ardenmyn oc, gollrish Dukeyn as Countyn, as ardenmyn joarree elley.","     She was saying that she had been at a party in Europe, and that there were many people there with titles, like Dukes and Counts, and other foreign titles.",
V’ee gra dy row ee bunnys er n’ghoaill nearey er y fa dy row ee theayagh.,She was saying that had almost been embarrassed because she was of the people.,
Ta mish credjal dy re feer hrimshagh eh shoh.,I believe that this is very sad.,
"Cha nod fer jannoo sporran sheeidagh ass cleash muickey, as cha nel ardenmyn erbee jannoo dooinney ooasle ass dooinney cadjin.","One cannot make a silk purse out of a pig’s ear, and no title at all makes a nobleman out of an ordinary man.",
"     Cha nel mish rieau er chur scansh da ardenmyn, foddee er y fa dy vel mee er ve aghoil dy liooar ayns my h-aegid dy bione dou kuse jeh fir as ardenmyn oc. Va paart jeu ommijagh myr sleih ooilley elley. ","     I have never laid importance on titles, maybe because I have been lucky enough in my youth that I knew some ones with titles. Some of them were foolish, as all other people.",
"     Fy yerrey, she Gael mish. As cha nel veg jeh ny flahee Gaelgagh foast er mayrn.","     In the end, I am a Gael. And none of the Gaelic princes are still around.",
Va ny flahee Yernagh marrooit ny eebrit ymmoddee keeadyn er dy henney.,The Irish princes were killed or driven out many centuries ago.,
"Va ny flahee Albinagh currit fo chosh ny Sostnee ymmoddee keeadyn er dy henney, as chyndaait rish far-hostnee beggey.","The Scottish princes were subdued (by) the English many centuries ago, and turned into little psuedo Englishmen.",
"Ta ny sleih as ardenmyn oc jiu joarree ooilley. My hirrys fer ny flahee Gaelgagh jiu, shegin dou jeeaghyn mygeayrt-y-mysh. [sic]","The people with titles today are all foreigners. If one searches for the Gaelic princes today, I (one) must look around him.",
Ta shin ooilley nyn flahee. As ta fys ec dagh ooilley Ghael as dagh ooilley Vanninagh dy n’eeu eshyn fer-ooasle Sostnagh erbee.,We are all princes. And every Gael and every Manx person knows that he is worth any English nobleman.,
Myr shen ta mee credjal dy re faghidagh eabyn jeh shiartanse dy hostnee dy lhig orrin dy vel ad ny share ny shinyn er yn oyr dy vel ardenmyn oc.,"So, I believe that attempts from several Englishman to pretend that they are better than us because they have titles are risible.",
"As myr ta fys ec Jee, ta fondid jeh sleih gollrish shoh ayns nyn ellan hannah. Foddee dy vel enney ec kuse jiu er shiartanse jeu.","And, as God knows, there is a sufficiency of people like this in our island already. Maybe a few of you know several of them.",
      S’trieh lhiam nagh dod mee yn colloo y screeu yn chiaghtin shoh chaie.,     I regret that I couldn’t write the column last week. ,
"Myr ta fys ec shiartanse jiu, va deiney ayns my oik voish Lunnin.","As several of you know, there were men in my office from London.",
Myr eiyrtys er shoh va mee throng dy debejagh as cha row traa ayms yn colloo y screeu.,As a consequence of this I was desperately busy and I didn’t have time to write this column.,
"     Tammylt er dy henney vrie mee son screeudeyryn elley dy chur cooney lhiam ayns yn obbyr shoh, as ta mee er n’gheddyn colloo ny ghaa voish Adrian y Phirgrin, cha nel peiagh erbee elley er arral e hirveishyn.","     A while ago I asked for other writers to help me in this work, and I have received a column or two from Adrian Pilgrim, no one else has volunteered his services.",
"Myr shen lhig dou briaght reesht, nagh by vie lesh peiagh erbee dy chooney lhiam?  ","So, let me ask again, wouldn’t anyone like to help me?",
S’yinyssagh yn roortys shoh dy yannoo ny share yn Ghaelg eu. As ny jean boirey mychione marranyn.,This exercise is wonderful for making your Manx better. And don’t worry about mistakes.,
"Foddym kiartaghey ad as eer my vees marran ny ghaa skyrraghtyn trooid yn varney, bee yn ’oill dy kinjagh currit er ny cloudeyryn.","I can correct them and even if a mistake or two will slide through the gap, the blame will be always put on the printers.",
