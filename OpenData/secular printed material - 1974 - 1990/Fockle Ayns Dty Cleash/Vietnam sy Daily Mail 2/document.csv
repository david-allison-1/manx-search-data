"AYNS y vee shoh chaie dobbyr da’n[1] Reiltys Viet Nam y Jiass[2] cohuittym, as ta shin er n’akin yn corvaal as treihys  haink er feallee cagjin myr eiyrtys. ","In the last last month the Government of Viet Nam on the South almost collapsed, and we have seen the chaos and misery that befell ordinary folk as a result. ","[1] dobbyr da] used in the late 20th C for ‘almost’, as in ‘the government almost collapsed’.
[2] Viet Nam y Jiass] ‘South Vietnam’ the unofficial name of ‘The Republic of Vietnam’ (1955 – 1975)."
"Myrgeddin, ta shin er n’akin yn aght ta ny Staydyn Unaneysit dy h-Americey er n’gheddyn, dy doaltattym, cooin-sheanse mychione cronney oikanyn, treoghanyn, as oainjyree faagit liorish ny h-Americanee, ayns y cheer hrimshagh shen.","Also, we have seen the way the United States of America have acquired, suddenly, a conscience about the lot of infants, orphans, and prostitutes left by the Americans, in that sad country.",
"Er a fa nagh mie lhien dy ve faagit mooie, ta ny Sostnee myrgeddin, dy doaltattym, er n’ennaghtyn dy vel eh orroo dy ve freggyrtagh son oikanyn Viet-Namagh. (Cre’n oyr, cha s’ayms!)","Because we don’t want to be left out, the English too, suddenly, have felt that they have to be answerable for Vietnamese infants. (Why, I don’t know!)",

"Veagh yn chooish shoh doogh dy liooar, as jiooldagh dy liooar, de beagh ny Americanee nyn lomarcan, agh ta shilley yn phabyr - naight ""Daily Mail"" lhiggey er dy vel eh ny sheshaght ghiastyllagh ny ’hilley feohdagh.","This matter would be dire enough, and disgusting enough, if the Americans were alone, but the sight of the “Daily Mail” newspaper pretending that it is a charitable organisation is a disgusting sight.",
"Dy chreck pabyryn-naight, ren yn “Daily Mail”, gyn nearey, paitchyn y gheidey voish Viet-Nam, as ghow eh ayrn ayns cloie feohdagh as jiooldagh ec yn Aer-phurt Heathrow ayns Lunnin.","To sell newspapers, the “Daily Mail”, shamelessly, stole children from Vietnam, and it took part in a disgusting and nauseous play at Heathrow Airport in London.",
"She da a pheccah t’er ve currit rish, ec y chooid sloo. Hoshiaght, ta peccah er ve currit rish noi ny paitchyn. Gyn scansh da nyn ayraghyn as moiraghyn, t’ad er ve geidit ersooyl. Agh bee ny paitchyn shoh dy kinjagh nyn Viet Namee. ","It is two sins that have been committed, at least. First, a sin has been committed against the children. Without regard to their fathers and mothers, they have been stolen away. But these children will always be Vietnamese. ",
"As traa [vees] ad aasit seose, bee ad meevaynrey as mestit; bee ad nyn joarreeyn dagh ooilley raad, chamoo bentyn da Viet Nam ny Sostyn.","And when they are grown up, they will be unhappy and mixed-up; they will be foreigners everywhere, neither belonging to Vietnam or England.",
"As my vees Viet Nam fo ny Communee, bee yn doilleeid ny smessey, er y fa nee ad gennaghtyn ad-hene dy ve nyn gemmyrkee, gollrish ny Palestinee ayns y Vean-lar.","And if Vietnam will be under the Communists, the difficulty will be worse, because they will feel themselves to be refugees, like the Palestinians in the Middle-East.",
"B'are daue geddyn baase ny surral cronney gollrish shen. As nah, t’eh jeeaghyn dy vel yn “Daily Mail” sheiltyn paitchyn joaree dy ve ny smoo scanshoil na ny paitchyn ayns ny h-ellanyn shoh.","It would be better for them to die than to suffer an inheritance like that. And second, it seems that the “Daily Mail” supposes foreign children to be more important than the children is these islands.",
"Ta ymmoddee oikanyn, as treoghaneyn ayns ny h-ellanyn shoh as adsyn laccal beaghey as coamrey.","There are many infants, and widows in these islands and that want (lack) food and clothing. ",
"Ayns Beeal Feirstey (Belfast) ta ymmoddee boghtey ayn, as ram treoghaneyn. Ayns ny ard-valjyn mooarey ta ymmoddee paitchyn boghtey, as feme mooar oc er cooney.","In Belfast there are many poor, and many widows. In the cities there are many poor children, and they have a great need for help.",
"Ta giastyllys goaill toshiaght dy valley.

And if the English are so stupid and so weak in their heads that they are forgetting the sussess of their own people in favour of success of a strong and foreign people, they deserve the world’s mockery and deserving of being destroyed by the Communists they are. ",
"Ta fuill ny s’chee na ushtey. As s’cair shen eh. Ta ny Sostnee dy jarroo ommidjagh. (Myr ta fys ec dagh ooilley Ghael, ta ny Sostnee rieau er ve bolvanagh, agh ayns traaghyn chaie, t’ad er ve ro niartal.

(As every Gael knows, the English have always been stupid, but in past times, they have been too powerful. Now that their might is reducing, their stupidity appear more obvious).",
