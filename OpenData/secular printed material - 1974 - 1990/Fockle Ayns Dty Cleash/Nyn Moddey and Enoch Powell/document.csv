Manx,English,Notes
"Foddee ny re lhiu moddey, myr s’lhiam-pene.[1] ","Maybe you own a dog, as I myself do (own a dog).","[1] Original gives [Foddee dy re lhiu moddey, myr s’lhiam-pene] Sometimes writers in the 1970s use [dy re] / [dy nee] as a dependent form of [S’], in which case the expected sentence would be [Foddee dy vel moddey lhiuish, myr ta moddey lhiam’s] ‘Maybe you own a dog, as do I (own a dog)’. Otherwise, [re] may be a typo for [mie], and [myr s’lhiam-pene] is a typo for [myr s’mie lhiam-pene], giving ‘Maybe you like a dog, as I myself like a dog’."
Hooar shin nyn moddey mee ny ghaa er dy henney as ish ny quallian eisht.,We got our dog a month or two ago and she was a puppy then.,
T’ee ny Labrador[2] as she feer aalin ee.,She’s a Labrador and very beautiful she is.,"[2] T’ee ny Labrador] In Classical Manx [t’ee ny] ’she’s a’ is used preceding a noun of occupation, relationship, stage of life, or nationality — but not when it describes an essential condition. [She Labrador ee], or [Labrador ee] would be expected here."
"Agh t’ee yn chied moddey dy row rieau ayms, as cha row mee aarloo son ny cliaghtaghyn cheerey eck!","But she is the first dog I have ever had, and I wasn’t ready for her country habits!",
"Er-lheh, cha row fys aym dy jinnagh ee gee dagh ooilley meer dy hrustyr oddagh ee geddyn as eshyn[3] eeagh!","In particular, I didn’t know that she would eat every piece of rubbish she could get that is edible!","[3] as eshyn] evidently the intended meaning is ‘that is’, (as found elsewhere in the late twentieth century) for which [ta] would be expected here."
 Agh dynsee mee tappee dy liooar. ,But I learned fast enough. ,
"S’yindyssagh[,] yn aght dynsee mee shen[4] tra v’ee er dilgey ooilley harrish yn gleashtan aym! Yn smoghan!","It’s wonderful, how I learned that when she had thrown up all over my car! The stink!",[4] original gives [eh shen]
"Chammah as moddey, ta kayt ain, as ta’n kayt as mee-hene cordail dy lane mychione ny cliaghtaghyn ec moddee. ","As well as a dog, we have a cat, and the cat and myself fully agree about the habits of dogs. ",
(Ga dy vel kuse dy chliaghtaghyn broighey ec yn chayt myrgeddin!),(Although the cat has a few filthy habits too!),
Ta ’nane jeh ny reddyn share da imbagh shoh ny bleeaney yn aght dy vel ny messyn fouyir cheet rish er ny biljyn as thammagyn. ,One of the best things for this season of the year is the way that the autumn fruits appear on the trees and bushes.,
"Hooar mee yn chied smeyr jeh’n vlein jea, as ga dy vel [row] eh red beg geauyr [sic], ghow mee soylley jeh, ny yeih.","I got the first blackberry of the year yesterday, and although it is a little sharp, I enjoyed it, nevertheless.",
"As yn jerrey-shiaghtin s’jerree hie shin seose Glion Dhoo erskyn Balley Logh, dy gheddyn frauaighyn [sic] millish voish yn freoaghane[5] er mullagh ny sleityn.","And last weekend we went up Glen Dhoo above Ballaugh, to find sweet blaeberries from the heather on top of the mountains.","[5] freoaghane] ‘bilberry’, ‘blaeberry’ — evidently here used in error instead of ‘freoagh’ — ‘heather’."
"By[6], drappal creoi eh, agh va ny freoghaneyn appee as blastal.","It was a hard climb, but the blaeberries were ripe and tasty.",[6] By] In the late twentieth century the verb [she] is often treated as if its past tense form [by] is productive.
As cha jeeck mee un phing orroo. ,And I didn’t pay one penny on them. ,
Ta messyn fadanagh yn thallooin nastee da dagh ooilley ’er. ,Fruits of the wilderness of the land are free for everyone.,
(My oddys oo drappal dy hymsaghey ad!),(If one can climb to gather them!),
"Va mee loayrt, laa ny ghaa er dy henney, rish ben voght ayns Doolish, as v’ee gra cre cho doillee as t’eh dy ’reayll chiass ayns y gheurey tra nagh vod ee fordrail dy chionnaghey geayl.","I was speaking, a day or two ago, to a poor woman in Douglas, and she was saying how difficult it is to maintain heat in the winter when she cannot afford to buy coal.",
As ghow mee toshiaght dy smooinaghtyn mychione yn voain ta er ny sleityn.,And I started to think about the peat that is on the mountains.,
"Foddee, yn arragh shoh cheet, dy vod sheshaght ennagh, mannagh vod yn reiltys-hene, moain y ghiarey da’n sleih boghtey.","Maybe, this coming Spring, some society could, if the government itself cannot, cut the peat for the poor people.",
" Veagh eh shen ny s’aasey, as ny smoo neugheyr[7] na kionnaghey geayl voish ny Sostnee.","That would be easier, and more inexpensive than buying coal from the English.",[7] ny smoo nuegheyr] ‘cheaper’ (lit. ‘more less expensive’)
Yeeagh mee riyr er yn chellveeish dy chlashtyn rish Enoch Powell.,I watched the television last night to hear Enoch Powell.,
"Myr va mee jeeaghyn haink mee dy ve ching ayns my ’hiolg, yn aght dy vel yn roddan Sosnagh shoh drappal er yn ’ainagh-chaggee jeh doal-chraueeaght[8] Prostanagh.  ","As I was watching I became sick in my stomach, the way that this English rat climbs on the war chariot of Protestant bigotry. ",[8] doal-chraueeaght] [doalchraueeaght] — ‘bigotry’ (Fargher)
Dy sauee Jee shin voish lhied ny deiney shoh.,God save us from such men as this.,
