Manx,English,Notes
Fockle Ayns Dty Chleaysh,A Word in Your Ear,
"MYR ta me er n'ghra roie, ta ny Manninee, er y fa dy vel ad er ve dellit myr fo-gheiney loirish ny Sostnee rish whilleen dy vleantyn, er choayll yn cliaghtey jeh smooinaghtyn buneydagh. ","As I have said before, the Manx, because they have been dealt with as untermenschen by the English for so many years, have lost the practice of original thinking.",
"(Dy aavioghey eh, t’eh orrin dy aavioghey nyn moyrn ayndooin-hene).",(To revive it we have to revive our pride in ourselves).,
"Myr shen, tra ta feme ain er smooinaghtyn noa, t'eh orrin dy vrie jeh cummaltee noa, ny dy gholl ersooyl dy 'akin yn aght ta fir elley gobbraghey.","So, when we need new thoughts, we have to ask new residents, or to go away to see the way other ones are working.",
"S’treih lhiam dy grha shoh, agh s'firrinagh eh, atreih! (Lhig dooin ooilley treishteil nagh bee eh myr shen rish foddey ayns [y] traa ry-heet).","I’m sorry to say this, but it is true, alas! (Let us all hope that it won’t be like that for long in the future).",
"Aghterbee, va mee smooinaghtyn er ny eieghyn shoh tra va mee shooyll ayns Straid ny Traie ayns Doolish, jeeaghyn er yn neeal fioghit ec yn straid shen, as yn aght dy vel Doolish tuittym cooyl Rhumsaa myr mean-happal. ","Anyway, I was thinking about these ideas when I was walking in Strand Streed in Douglas, looking at the faded countenance of that street, and the way that Dougals is falling behind Ramsey as a shopping centre. ",
"Dy jarroo, ta Doolish ayns stayd sie. Ta sleih faagail dy vaghey ayns Kione-Droghad; ta ny tackyn-ynnydagh ro ard, ta ny troggallyn tuittym sheese, ta’n balley jeeaghyn ny smoo as ny smoo skee as donnan, lesh Thalloo-Souree, lostit, Straid Chester lhiegget, yn key cheu ny howe ayns stroialtys.","Indeed, Douglas is in a bad state. People are leaving to live in Onchan; the local-taxes (rates) are too high, the buildings are falling down, the town looks more and more tired and wretched, with Summerland, burnt, Chester Street knocked down, the South Quay in destruction.",
"Kied echey[1], er-lhiam nagh vod fer jerkal rish tooilley voish Coonseil-balley ta ny smoo gollrish sheshaght dy 'henn-obbreeyn[2] Oik-Phost, as carrooee thallooin. ","Whether, I think one cannot expect more from a town council that is more like a team of old post-office workers, and land speculators. ","[1] The article seems to be missing some words here.
[2] ’henn-obbreeyn] original gives [’henn-obbreeghyn]"
"As myr s’leah fodmayd g’aa-reaghey reiltys ynnydagh, ny share bee[3] eh.","And the sooner we can rerrange local government, the better it will be.",[3] bee] — [vees] expected here.
"Ny yeih, ga dy vel eh gollrish ceau pearlyn roish muckyn, verrym dau un eie. Lhisagh straid ny traie[4] ve aa-phemmadit. ","Nevertheless, although it is like casting pearls before swine, I will give them an idea. Strand Street should be repaved. ",[4] straid ny traie] evidently [Strand Street] see also [Straid Gheinnee].
"Lhisagh ny pemmadyn cooney ve goit ersooyl, as liackyn[5] noa glenney currit sheese. Eisht, lhisagh tubbyryn lesh lussyn ve currit ayns y straid.","The narrow pavements should be taken away, and clean new paving stones put down. Then, tubs with plants should be be in the street.","[5] Original gives [lak], taken here to be a typo for [liackyn] ‘slabs’ / ‘paving stones’."
"Lurg shen, ver yn straid nearey er ny shappyn graney as d’yn n’greinnaghey dy lhiassaghey nyn shappyn. As cha by chostal shoh. ","After that, the street will shame the ugly shops and be encouraging them to improve their shops. And this wouldn’t be expensive. ",
"Agh veagh yn anchaslys eddyr yn straid roie, as yn straid lurg yn obbyr shoh cho mooar, yeeaghagh[6] eh gollrish mirril.","But the difference between the street before, and the street after this work so great, it would look like a miracle.",[6] jeeaghagh] original gives [jeeaghagh]
"As dy ghreinnaghey yn chymskil troggal dy hroggal thieyn noa ayns Doolish-hene, lhisagh troggal thieyn noa er thalloo moidynagh ve obbit. ","As to encourage the building industry to build new houses in Douglas itself, the building of new houses on virgin land should be refused. ",
"As myrgeddin, lhisagh yn slane Sheading dy Viddle ve fo un reiltys-ynnydagh, lesh e heet-stiagh cheet voish yn Reiltys Veanagh, as reaghit gollrish yn Voayrd-Ynsee, lesh oltaghyn voish Tynvaal chammah as adsyn reihit dy jeeragh.","And also, the whole Sheading of Middle should be under one local government, with its income coming from the Manx Government, and arranged like the Board of Education, with members from Tynwald as well as those directly elected.",
"Ta mee goaill yindys, ny keayrtyn, er shen yinnagh yn shenn-ayr aym er n’ghraa dy beagh eh er ve bio nish. She meoir dy Ghoolish v'eh, as ren eh yn Raad Mooar enmyssit Bayr Phurt-ny-hinshey, as hoie eh ny biljyn er cheu lheeantyn Phurt y Chee.","I wonder sometimes about what my grandfather would have said said if he had been alive now. He was a mayor of Douglas, and he made the Highway called Peel Road, and he set the trees on the side of the meadows of Port-e-chee.",
"Foddee oo neesht e ennym y 'akin er leac er boalley yn droghad Ghoolish ec kione yn phurt. Dy oddagh eh fakin yn Coonseil-Balley ec y traa t'ayn, as yn neuchummeydys oc, hyndaagh eh ayns e oaie.","You can still see his name on a plaque on the wall of Douglas Bridge at the end of the port. If he could see the Town Council at the moment, and their incompetence, he would turn in his grave.",
"Agh roish my vees Barrantee voish bailey elley erbee' cogher-jaghey ad-hene, cha nel yn Coonseil Ghoolish ny lomarcan. ","But before Commissioners from any other town congratulate themselves, the Douglas Council are not alone.",
"Lhisagh Bailey Chashal goaill nearey, son y boghlanys ta goll er sheidey mygeayrt ayns y valley shen, ny pabyryn miljanyn as trustyr phlastic ayns dagh ooilley chooyll. Faagym ny fir elley ny lomarcan jiu, er y fa nagh vel spoar dy liooar aym jiu.","Castletown should be ashamed, for the rubbish that is being blown around in that town, the sweet papers and plastic refuse in every nook. I will leave the others alone today, because I don’t have enough space today.",
