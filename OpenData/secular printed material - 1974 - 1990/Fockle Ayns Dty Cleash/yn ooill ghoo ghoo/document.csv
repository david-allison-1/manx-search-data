Manx,English,Notes
"Fastyr dy row, mysh kegeeish er dy henney, yeeagh mee er cloie er yn chellveeish, enmyssit “Yn Cheviot, yn Feeaih, as yn Ooil ghoo, ghoo.”[1]","One afternoon, about a fortnight ago, I watched a play on the television, called “The Cheviot, The Stag, and the Black, Black Oil.”","[1] Yn Cheviot, yn Feeaih, as yn Ooil ghoo ghoo] This is evidently ‘Play for Today’ production of the play “The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black, Oil” written by J. McGrath and broadcast by the BBC on June 6th 1974. Its theme is the economic exploitation of Highlands and cultural and economic destruction of its Gaelic communities from 1746 to 1974. Branlaadagh chooses [feeaih] ‘deer’, rather than [dow] ‘stag’. [ooil] / [ooill] ‘oil’ is considered to be a masculine noun elsewhere in the corpus, so [ooil doo, doo] would be expected here."
"Cha row eh ny chloie dy firrinagh, er y fa dy row eh coontey jeh’n shennaghys traartyssagh ec ny deiney mooinjerey ain ayns Gaeltaght ny h-Albey.","It wasn’t truly a play, because it was an account of the desolating history of our kinsmen in the Scottish Highlands.",

","Economic power is the most important power, and in comparison with political power, it is exceedingly powerful. At the present time, the Isle of Man’s oil rights have been given to England for a share of the taxes from oil in the United Kingdom. The English now have all the economic power. ","[2] Ta pooar harmaynagh yn phooar smoo scanshoil] ‘Economic power is the most important power’ — NB: [pooar] is a masculine noun in Classical Manx. It is usual in Manx to use the following type of construction when the head noun is being coupled with a definite noun; [She yn pooar smoo scanshoil ta pooar ta tarmaynagh]. 
[3] ayns cosoylagh lesh] ‘in comparison with’. [ayns cosoylagh rish] ‘in comparison to’ would be expected here."

"Ta mee er n’gheddyn er-y-gherrit screeuyn voish Chalse mac Guard, ta cummal ayns yn Erin ec y traa t’ayn.","I have recently received a letter from Charles Guard, who lives in Ireland at the present time.",

"T’eh gra, “Myr dy kinjagh, va Ellan Vannin laccal dy mooar cooney as sleih.","He says, “As always, the Isle of Man was greatly lacking help and people.",
"Ta’n sleih Kernagh jannoo reddyn mooar, as car ny feailley, hug ad Oie Chernagh, aynsyn yeeagh ad fillymyn, as ghow ad arraneyn, as hug ad taishbyn jeh gleck Kernagh as, fy-yerrey, va dagh ooilley pheiagh gee Berreenyn Kernagh.”","The Cornish people are doing great things, and during the festival, they gave a Cornish Night, in which they showed films, and they sang songs, and they gave a display of Cornish wrestling, and finally, everyone was eating Cornish cakes.",

Nevertheless, the new calendar is beautiful, and no doubt, it is the fisrt calendar being sold for 1975.","[6] roish my vel shin er] ‘before we have‘ — [roish my vees shin er] would be expected here.
[7] she aalin yn feaillere noa] ‘the new calendar is beautiful’. As the copular verb [she] does not precede an adjective or preposition, unless it is intended to demonstrate contrast, the expected construction here would be [Ta’n feaillere noa aalin] ‘the new calendar is beautiful’."
