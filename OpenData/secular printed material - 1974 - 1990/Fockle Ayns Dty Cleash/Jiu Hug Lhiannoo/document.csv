I bought a new recording called “Renaissance of the Celtic Harp,” with music by Alan Stivell, from Brittany, in France. How beautiful this recording is, with music from Britanny on one side and from Gaeldom (including Ireland, Scotland and Mann) on the other side. There is one song from the Isle of Man on it.","[1] Aa-ruggey ny Cruit] the first element [Aa-ruggey] is evidently ‘Rebirth’ / ‘Renaissance’, see’ [aavioaghey] / [ruggyr reesht]. [ny Cruit], is evidently ‘of the harp’. See [krŵit] ‘harp’ in Philips’ Book of Pslams, see also  [claasagh]. 
[2] lhiattee] ‘side’, usually used for the ‘side’ of a mountain, or body or in phrases such as [rish lhiattee] ‘aside’ ‘to one side’. See also [er çheu elley], [er y laue elley].

There is great deal of rubbish being spoken about this act, and there are many columns appearing in the newspapers and they are incorrect and foolish. Let us, therefore, look at the act.","[3] as adsyn] ‘and they are’ (usage peculiar to late 20th century). 
[4] sou-cheeayllagh] evidently, ‘foolish’, formed with the negative prefix [sou] from [sou-aigney] ‘discontent’ and [keeaylagh] ‘prudent’, ‘reasonable’. "

But if he does this, this action will be illegal in the Isle of Man, and the beneficiaries will be able to sue him. And unless he pays the tax, it is illegal in England, and the next time he goes to England, the English can sue him in England.",

The English are attempting to take taxes from Manx residents against Manx Law.",
,"The New Residents from England are not important. The world is big enough and if we are looking for New Residents (and I don’t think that they are needed), there are many other countries. But we must, absolutely, resist the way that the English impose upon us. Even until complete independence. ",
"Gyn keeshyn fegooish shassoo theayreillagh! As er yn oyr nagh mie lhien shassoo theayreillagh ayns Sostyn, gyn keeshyn Sostynagh dy bollagh.","No taxes without democratic representation! And because we don’t like democratic representation in England, no English taxes entirely.",
"     Fy-yerrey, fockle da mec Vannin. Cre vel shiu? Ta shoh yn red smoo scanshoil politicagh t’er daghyrt neayr’s 1765. Cre vel shiu?","     Finally, a word for Mec Vannin (a nationalist Manx political party). Where are you? This is the most important political matter that has happened since 1765. Where are you?",
