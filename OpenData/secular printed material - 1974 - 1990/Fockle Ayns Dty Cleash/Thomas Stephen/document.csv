"She shenn charrey aym eh (d’obbree shin lesh-y-cheilley er ny cabbyl-charryn er Shooylaghan Ghooilsh tra va shin nyn studeyryn), as ga dy vel beeal vooar echey, ta’n cree echey ayns y voayl kiart, as t’eh ny Manninagh dooie voish Purt-ny-h’Inshey gollrhym-pene.","He is an old friend of mine (we worked with each other on the horse-trams on Douglas Promenade when we were students), and although he has a big mouth, his heart is in the right place, and he is a true Manxman from Peel like myself.",
" Ayns e screeuyn, t’eh gra:—","In his letter, he says:—",
"“Dy row eh foddey voym dy ghreinaghey eab erbee dy aavioghey yn chengey Gaelgagh barbaragh, agh er-lhiam dy beagh symm ayd er yn ‘photostat’ marish shoh, foddee nagh vel oo er n’akin.","“That it is far from me to encourage any attempt to revive the barbarous Gaelic tongue, but I think you would be interested in the attached ‘photostat’, that you may not have seen.",
"“Hooar mee yn pabyr bunneydagh tra va mee ronsaghey ny recortyssyn jeh’n Cheshaght Vible Ghoaldagh as Joarree, as shirrey screeunyn mychione yn chur-magh jeh’n Vible Vanninagh ayns 1819.",“I found the original paper when I was researching the records of the British and Foreign Bible Society and searching for letters about the publication of the Manx Bible in 1819.,
"Er cooyl yn phabyr ta chyndaays ayn as ga nagh vod yn earroo-hraa ve er ny chronnaghey, shegin da ve voish mysh yn traa shen.","On the back of the paper there is a translation and although the date cannot be discerned, it must be from about that time. ",
"“Voish screeuyn ayns ny recortyssyn ro-imraait, currit gys yn cheshaght voish yn Arrymagh Thomas Stephen, jeh Marooney, as earrooit 8oo Lhuanistan 1812, ta mee cur aaraa","“From a letter in the aforementioned records, sent to the society from the Reverend Thomas Stephen, of Marown, and dated the eighth of August 1812, I give a quotation",
"“Va daa ’housane vacliooar dy lioaryn padjer Gaelgagh ain, clouit liorish stoyr-argid voish yn Cheshaght son coyrt er-y-hoshiaght tushtey Chreesteeagh.","“We had two thousand copies of Manx prayer books, printed by means of a financial fund from the Society for Promoting Chrisitian Knowledge.",
"Tannee lieh ny lioaryn dy bragh gyn ymmyd, er y fa nagh vel peiagh erbee kiarail ny briaght my-nyn-gione.","Half of the books remained forever without use, because no one cared or asked about them.",
"Ta ny dellalyn co-chionnaghtal jeh’n cheer beg shoh bishaghey dagh laa, as ta shoh jannoo yn Vaarle dy ve chengey ny smoo ymmydagh.","The trade dealings of this little country increase every day, and this makes English the more useful language.",
"Ta yn Ghaelg, dy ve shickyr loayrit, bunnys dy slane, oscsyn ta shenn as neu-ynsit, as er-y-fa shen, t’ee, er y chooid smoo, er ny tregeil liorish yn cheeloghe s’aa[1].”","Manx, to be sure, is spoken, almost exlusively, by those who are old and uneducated, and therefore, it is, for the most part, abandoned by the younger generation.",[1]] liorish yn çheeloghe saa] — original gives [liorish yn ’heeloghe ny s’saa]
Ta’n shenn phabyr shoh gra (ta mee er n’glenney yn grammar as yn Baarlaghys red beg) myr ta geiyrt:—,This old paper says (I have purified the grammar and the Anglicisation a little bit) as follows:—,
Da Cummaltee Ellan Vannin,To Residents of the Isle of Man,
“Ta bing ny Sheshaght ayns yn Ellan shoh cour skeaylley ny Scriptyryn Casherick goaill taitnys dy hoilshaghey da ny deiney-cheerey ec dy vel ad er n’geddyn veih yn Cheshaght Vible ayns Lunnin stoyr berchagh jeh Goo Yee ayns chengey ny mayrey Ellan Vannin.,“The committee of the Society in this Island for spreading the Holy Scriptures takes pleasure in advertising to her fellow countrymen that they have received from the Bible Society in London a wealthy fund of God’s Word in the mother tongue of the Isle of Man.,
"“Liorish feoiltys Chreestee as ny Sheshaght shen, ta queig thousane maclioaryn jeh yn slane Scriptyr er ve clouit ayns Gaelg. ","“By means of Christian charity and that Society, five thousand copies of the entire Scripture have been printed in Manx. ",
"T’ad chebbal shoh ec mysh lieh jeh’n chost oc, ta shen dy ghra ec shey skillinyn Sostnagh son dagh maclioar jeh’n Chenn Chonaant, as y Chonaant Noa ayns un lioar.","They are offering this at about half of their cost, that is to say at six English shillings for each copy of the Old Testament, and the New Testament in one book.",
"Shoh t’ad jannoo veih’n yeearee jeein t’oc dy vod caa ve ec y vooinjer s’boghtee ny mast’ain dy ronsaghey ny Scriptyryn Casherick ayns chengey ny mayrey oc-hene, as yn chengey ta’n tushey (tushtey) share oc.","This they are doing from the earnest desire they have that the poorest people amongst us may have the opportunity to research the Holy Scriptures in their own mother tongue, the language that they understand best.",

"“Ta’n Cheshaght Vible skeaylley ny Scriptyryn Casherick ayns dagh ooilley ayrn jeh’n theihll, as t’ad kiarail, lesh cooney Yee, gyn dy scuirr veih nyn obbyr dy ghraih derrey ta Goo Yee ayns laue dagh ooilley ghooinney er y thalloo.","“The Bible Society distributes the Holy Scriptures in every part of the world, and they intend, with God’s help, to not cease from their work of love until God’s Word is in the land of every man on Earth.",
Ny lhig da Cummaltee Vannin ve yn Vooinjer s’jerree dy chooney lhieu ayns y chooish gloyroil shoh. ,Don’t let the Residents of the Isle of Man be the last people to help them in this glorious matter.,
Lhig daue prowal yn graih t’oc er Goo Yee liorish jannoo ooilley ny oddys ad dy choyrt yn chaghteraght shoh dy hauailtys gys dagh ashoon feiy ny cruinney.,Let them prove their love of God’s Word by doing all that they can to send this message of salvation to every nation throughout the world.,
"“Lhig da dagh ooilley ghooinney, ben as paitchey ta lhaih, ny clashtyn ny focklyn shoh coyrt ry-lhiattee wheesh as oddys ad spaarail dy chosney ny Scriptyryn Casherick, hoshiaght son yn ymmyd oc-hene, as lurg shen, son ymmyd ny mraaraghyn boghtey chammah ayns y cheer shoh, as ayns cheeraghyn elley.","“Let every man, woman and child who reads, or hears these words put aside as much as they can spare to get the Holy Scriptures, first for their own use, and after that for the use of their poor brothers both in this country, and in other countries.",
" Lhig dauesyn, ta lane oc, coyrt dy palchey, as lhig dauesyn nagh vel agh beg oc goaill kiarail dy choyrt dy gennal jeh’n veggan shen.”"," Let them, who have much, give plenty, and let those who only have a little take care to give cheerfully of that little.”",
"     Cha nel yn pabyr shoh ny obbyr jeh feeuid lettyragh mooar, agh t’eh symmoil, er-lhiam.","     This paper is not a work of great literary worth, but it is interesting, I think.",
Agh ta mee sheiltyn dy row goaill Creesteeaght da ny Manninee red beg gollrish goaill skeddan gys Purt-ny-h’Inshey.,But I guess that taking Christianity to the Manx was a little like taking herrings to Peel.,
" Tra ta shin geaishtagh rish ny Sostnee, cha greddagh fer dy row ny Manninee nyn Greestee ymmoddee sheeloghyn roish my daink ny Sostnee magh ass ny biljyn ayns mean-Europey.","When we listen to the English, one wouldn’t believe that the Manx were Christians many generations before the English came out of the trees in central Europe.",
