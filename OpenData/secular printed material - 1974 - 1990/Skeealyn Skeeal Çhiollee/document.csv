"     It is a great pleasure to welcome this little book, and its author—Mr. Arthur S. B. Davies.",She lesh taitnys mooar ta mee g’oltaghey y lioaran shoh as yn ughtar j’ee — Mainstyr Arthur S. B. Davies.,
"     In introducing Mr. Davies to the people of Man, let me say that he is a fellow country-man of that great Welshman, Bishop Pjillips, to whom we are indebted for the earliest writing we possess in the Manx language, namely the Book of Common Prayer, translated into Manx by that good bishop (1625-30). Mr Davies is conversant wth all the Celtic tongues, and he has lived among the peoples who use them daily, from the Islands off the North West Coast of Scotland to the peninsula of Brittany.","     Lhig dou cur er enn eh da’n phobble Vanninagh; she Bretnagh dooie eshyn. Ta shin cooinaghtyn dy re Bretnagh myrgeddin eshyn ren hoshiaght yn Ghailck Vanninagh y screeu — yn Aspick Phillips, tra hyndaa eh Lioar ny Padjer ’sy ghlare ghooie ain.

"     In 1946 Mr. Davies came to visit the Isle of Man, ad he met all the native Manx speakers. On his return he published an intersting article on the Manx language in the “Bulletin of Celtic Studies.”","     Haink eh dy chur shilley er Ellan Vannin ’sy vlein 1946, as haink eh ny whail rish gagh Manninagh va loayrt yn Ghailck ec y traa shen, as tra rosh eh dy-valley reesht, screeu eh coontey ny glare ain va currit magh ayns y “Bulletin of Celtic Studies”.",
"And now he has given us this little volume, which it is my pleasure to introduce — not without hope that it may be the fore-runner of other Manx works from his pen. He has the authentic Celtic style and is well equipped to write in our language.","     T’eh nish cur magh yn lioran shoh as foddee dy vel lioran elley ayns laue dy eiyrt er. Ta ny skeealyn scruit dy-mie, as s’leayr dooin dy vel Mnr. Davies lane ynsit as aghtal ayns y ghlare ghooie ain.",
    There is a peculiar MANX flavour about these tales. As I read them I had little difficulty in picturing our forefathers exchanging yarns of the same character as they sat around the fireside in the days of long ago.,"     Gyn dooyt, ta blass lajer Manninagh ayns ny “Skeealyn Cheeil-Çhiollee.” Choud’s va mee lhaih ad cha row eh ny red doillee dou dy akin, lesh sooillyn m’aigney ny shenn ayraghyn ainyn g’insh ry-cheilley skeealyn jeh’n vun cheddin, myr v’ad nyn soie rish y chiollagh ayns laghyn foddey er-dy-henney.",
"     Every Manx student must read this book to savour for himself the pleasure Mr. Davies has given us. And all who read it will, I feel sure, express the hope that the time is not far off when the writer will give us some more tales of the same kind.","     Lhig da dy-chooilley studeyr Manninah lhaih yn lioran shoh, as eisht jir ad, ta mee smooinaght — “Gur eh mie mooar eu, Vainstyr Davies, son y taitnys ta shiu er chur dooin, as ny lhig da’n traa ve foddey roish my screeuys shiu yn lheid cheddin dy skeealyn elley.”",

"“You heard’ve many times that the mind has a great amount of power on the health or ill-health of the body, and true enough that is,” said my uncle Edward. Here for you is a story them, as true as it can be.","“Cheayll oo keayrt ny ghaa dy vel ec yn aigney cooid-vooar dy phooar er slaynt ny er aslaynt y chorp, as s’feer dy-liooar shen,” dooyrt my naim Edard. Er hoh dhyts skeeal eisht, cho firrinagh as oddys ee ve.",
"     After I had grown up into a young man, I came to be very tired of farm work, it was too easy-going a life for me, and I had heard that good pay was to be had in the cotton-mill in Yr Wyddgrug (a town in Wales.) and off I went to there to seek work.","     Lurg dooys v’er n’aase seose my ghooinney aeg, haink mee dy ve feer skee jeh obbyr-eiringagh, ve ny vioys ro hoccaragh dooys, as va mee er chlashtyn dy row faill vie ry-gheddyn ayns y wyllin-cadee ayns Yr Wyddgrug (balley ayns Bretin.) as ersooyl lhiam dys shen dy hirrey obbyr.",
"     I got work right away, and I was a sort of assistant with the spinners, and I was very happy with my situation. There was another young man there and he was about the same age as me, a boy who had lost one eye, but, nevertheless, he saw more with his one than other boys would be usually see with two eyes!","     Hooar mee obbyr çhelleeragh, as va mee my horçh dy chooneyder lesh ny sneeuderyn as va mee feer vaynrey lesh my stayd.

"     He was called William James, and he was a very mischievious boy. He and I came to be friends in a short time. Williams and I would be taking companionship {??} in tricks and joking every day. But it was understood between Williams and I that we had to accept the blame after one another (in turns). That way we were avoiding one castigation!","     V’eh enmyssit William James, as she guilley feer vitçhooragh v’eh. Haink eshyn as mish dy ve nyn gaarjyn ayns traa gerrid.

Myr shen va shin shaghney un smaght!",
"     Thomas Burgess was the man who was foreman in the spinning room, and he was one of the cruellest and hateful ones towards the workers that I ever saw. But Burgess really loved joking and had committed provocative tricks against the men he had charge of, and so, he showed plenty of favour to William and I.","     She Thomase Burgess yn dooinney va ny ’urriman ’sy çhamyr-snauee, as v’eh ’nane jeh ny fir s’dewiley as s’dwoaiagh rish ny fir-obbree honnick mee rieau.

"     I had read somewhere that a man could exhort and make a healthy man believe that he is sick, and a sick man to believe that he is healthy, unless his sickness were too serious.","     Va mee er lhaih boayl ennagh dy voddagh fer coyrlaghey as cur er dooinney slayntoil dy chredjal dy vel eh çhing, as er dooinney çhing dy chredjal dy vel eh follan, mannagh beagh y çhingys echey ro hrome.",
"     Once, while were having our dinner, I mentioned this to Thomas Burgess, and he said: it’s easy to test the matter, if you and Wil James would put your heads together (to see) how you’ll do it to one of these ones. If Wil can’t do something, I’ll be amazed, because I think he’s a very skillfull boy.","      Keayrt dy row, as shinyn goaill nyn yinnair, ren mee gimraa y chooish shoh rish Thomase Burgess, as dooyrt eshyn: S’aashagh prowal y yannoo er y chooish, my yinnagh uss as Wil James cur nyn ging ry-cheilley [dy ’akin][2] crenaght [9] nee shiu eh er ’nane jeh ny fir shoh.

"     I spoke to Wil about Burgess’ secret, and before the night Wil had prepared a trick!","     Loayr mee rish Wil mychione yn tannish ec Burgess, as roish yn oie va cluic er ny yannoo aarloo ec Wil!",
"     There was one of the spinners and his name (was) Jac Jones, a man who was always wearing a top-hat, and he was leaving (used to leave) it on a nail outside the spinning room. Wil thought to (decided to) tie a fine black string, but strong enough, around about the base of the hat, right above the edge, and to draw it in about a quarter-inch, and a quarter-inch is two sizes, you see, in a hat, and then to make Jac Jones believe that his head had swollen.","     Va fer jeh ny sneeuderyn as yn ennym echey Jac Jones, ny ghooinney va dy-kinjagh ceau top-hat, as v’eh faagail eh er treiney çheu-mooie jeh’n çhamyr-sneeuee. Va Wil smooinaghtyn dy chiangley streng ghoo cheyl, agh lajer dy-liooar, mygeayrt-y-mysh bun yn edd, dy-jeeragh erskyn yn oirr, as dy hayrn eh stiagh mysh kerroo-oarlagh, as ta kerroo-oarlagh ny ghaa vooadys[3], t’ou toiggal, ayns edd, as eisht dy chur er Jac Jones dy chredjal dy row e chione er n’att.",[3] kerroo-oarlagh ny ghaa vooadys] ‘two inches is two sizes’ — [ny] seems to be an error here.
"     The next day, in the morning, as soon as Jac Jones went to his work, Wil tied the string around the hat, and in line with our  agreement, I went and I said to Jac, “John Jones, aren’t you too well in health this morning?” and he (said), “Oh, it isn’t anything,” I said, “but I think there’s some swelling in your head.”","     ’Sy voghrey laa-ny-vairagh, cho leah as hie Jac Jones gys e obbyr, chiangle Wil yn treng mygeayrt yn edd, as reir nyn goardail, hie mish as dooyrt mee rish Jac, “John Jones, nagh vel shiu ro vie ayns slaynt moghrey jiu?” as eshyn. “Och, cha nel eh veg,” dooyrt mish, “agh ta mee smooinaghtyn dy vel att ennagh ’sy chione eu.”",
"     “Not at all, I am in good health, and indeed, I am grateful for it,” answered Jac.","     “Cha nel edyr, ta mish ayns slaynt vie, as dy-jarroo ta mee booisal er e son,” dreggyr Jac.",
"     About seven o’ clock, Wil went to him, and he said: “John Jones, you’re not looking like yourself today, do you have a pain in your head?”","     Mysh shiaght er y chlag hie Wil huggey, as dooyrt eh: “John Jones, cha nel shiu jeeaghyn gollriu-hene jiu, vel pian ’sy chione eu?”",
"     “No, indeed not,” said Jac, “but Ned was just now asking the same thing, what made you think such a thing?”","     “Cha nel, dy-jarroo,” dooyrt Jac, “agh va Ned dy-jeeragh nish briaght yn red cheddin, c’red hug ort smooinaghtyn y lhied?”",
"     “I don’t know,” said Wil, “but your head looks a little bit funny, as if you had gotten a ‘hit to the side’ (side-swipe? hit sidways?) at it. Let me see the other side. Oh, no, they’re both similar (to eachother), I was only imagining, I think,” and off went Wil to his work.","     “Cha ’s ayms,” dooyrt Wil, “agh ta’n kione eu jeeaghyn cooid veg aitt myr dy row shiu er n’gheddyn builley ry-lhiattee echey[4]. Lhig dou fakin y cheu elley. Och, cha nee, t’ad ny-neesht gollrish y cheilley, cha row mish agh sheiltyn, er-lhiam,” as ersooyl lesh Wil gys e obbyr.",[4] er n’gheddyn builley ry-lhiattee echey] it is not clear what is intended by [echey].
"     About five minutes before the time of the first meal, Burgess himself went to him and he said, “Here you are, Jac, you were at some scuffle last night! You’ve been drunk again, I know, because your head is like a big round turnip!","     Mysh queig minnidyn roish traa yn chied lhongee hie Burgess-hene huggey as dooyrt eh, “Er-hoh uss, Yac, v’ou uss rish streeu ennagh riyr!

,[10],
"     Or else, have you got mumps? It’s going around at the moment.”",     Er nonney vel yn gorley-scoarnee ort? Te goll mygeayrt ec y traa t’ayn.”,
"     “I haven’t tasted a small drop (single drop) for a week, and my head is as good as any of your heads,” answered Jac abruptly.","     “Cha nel mee er vlashtyn bine beg neayr’s shiaghtin, as ta my chione cho mie as kione erbee euish-hene,” dreggyr Jac dy-doaltattym.",
"     “I hope that you’re telling the truth,” said Burgess, and away he went.","     “Ta mee treishteil dy vel oo ginsh yn irriney,” dooyrt Burgess, as ersooyl lesh.",
"     When Jac Jones was going to his meal, and trying to put his hat on his head, he couldn’t manage it at all. He looked (to see) if he had taken some other hat, but he remembered himself that no one was wearing a top-hat except himslef, and as well, his name written by his own hand was in the inside of the hat. He borrowed a cap for going to his meal, and he brought the hat in his hand.","     Tra va Jac Jones goll dys e lhongey, as shirrey cur e edd er e chione, cha daink eh lesh edyr. Ren eh jeeaghyn row eh er n’ghoaill edd ennagh elley, agh chooinee eh er-hene nagh row fer erbee ceau top-hat agh eh hene, as myrgeddin, va e ennym scruit liorish e laue-hene ayns çheusthie yn edd. Hooar eh bayrn er eeassaght cour goll dys e lhongey, as hug eh lesh yn edd ’sy laue.",
"     Jac didn’t come back to his work. Burgess visited him at midday, and he found him in bed, suffering with a cruel pain in his head. Burgess said to Jac that he was no doubt sick now, but that there was a treatment to give him an instant cure, and that he himself would bring the treatment to him in the afternoon, after the mill had stopped.","     Cha daink Jac er-ash dys e obbyr. Hug Burgess shilley er ec munlaa, as hooar eh ayns y lhiabbee eh, surranse lesh guin g[h]ewil ayns e chione.

"     Burgess and I went to visit Jac that night and we brought a small amount of sweet oil in a bottle. Whilst Burgess and Jac’s wife were up in the bedroom putting the oil on poor Jac’s head, I was pulling the sting off the hat, and then, to show how effective the treatment was, Burgess said to the wife to go and bring up up the hat to him, and behold! Now Jac was easily able to put the hat on his head. Truly, with so much oil as there was on his head, the hat slid almost too easily, and how good it was that Jac had big enough ears to prevent the hat from going over his face. But how amazing it was, although the swelling had gone away straight away, the pain didn’t stop so quickly, and Jac Jones was at home for a week before he went back to his work.","     Hie Burgess as mish dy chur shilley er Jac yn oie shen as hug shin lhien cooid veg dy ooill villish ayns boteil. Choud as va Burgess as ben Jac heose ’sy çhamyr-cadlee cur yn ooill er kione Jac boght, va mish heese tayrn yn treng jeh’n edd, as eisht, dy yeeaghyn cre cho fondagh as va’n lheihys, dooyrt Burgess rish y ven dy gholl as cur lh’ee seose huggey yn edd, as cur-my-ner! nish haink eh lesh Jac dy chur yn edd dy-aashagh er e chione.

"     He didn’t find out about the trick for three more weeks, and he never forgave us!","     Cha dooar eh fys mychione y chrout rish tree shiaghtinyn elley, as cha ren eh rieau leih dooin!",

William the Shepherd,Illiam yn Bochilley,
"     Do I remember about the tale of William the Shepherd? Yes, indeed, as if it only happened yesterday, said my uncle Edward, and a very strange account it is too. Illiam was one of the most good-looking men you ever saw; he was above six feet in height and stong and stout in (his) body. He was considered also, amongst his neighbours, as one of the bravest and most fearless men you could meet in a year. That was good for William, because due to his career, he had to be travelling the mountains every hour of the night and in every sort of weather.","     Vel cooinaghtyn aym er skeeal Illiam yn Bochilley? Ta, dy-jarroo, myr nagh haghyr eh agh yn laa v’ayn jea, dooyrt my naim Edard, as she coontey feer yoarree eh neesht. She ’nane jeh ny deiney s’aaley honnick oo rieau va Illiam; v’eh erskyn shey trieyn ’syn yrjid[6], as lajer as tramylt va’n corp echey. V’eh coontit myrgeddin mastey e naboonyn myr ’nane jeh ny deiney s’dunnal as s’neuagglee oddagh oo çheet ny whail ayns blein. By vie shen da Illiam, son kyndagh rish e cheird, b’egin da ve troailt ny sleityn gagh oor jeh’n oie as ayns gagh sorçh dy emshir","[6] ’syn yrjid] ‘in the height’, evidently an error for [er yrjid] ‘in height’."
"     Illiam was a true shepherd indeed, and if there were any misfortune befalling the sheep, the roughness of the weather wouldn’t make him neglect them at all: he put his life in danger many times for an old sheep or a small lamb that was only worth very little. And I think that God is looking lovingly on a man for things such as that.","     She bochilley firrinagh dy-jarroo va Illiam, as dy beagh drogh-haghyrt erbee çheet er ny kirree, cha jinnagh garrooid ny h-earish cur er jannoo beggan dy veerioose orroo: hug eh e vioys ayns gaue keayrt ny ghaa er son shenn cheyrrey ny eayn beg nagh row feeu agh feer veg. As er-lhiams dy vel Jee jeeaghyn dy-graihagh er dooinney son lheid ny reddyn shen.",
"     Now, William was going out with a girl in the neighbourhood and about to marry her, and Susan was a very strange lass. I remember her well, and after Illiam had ‘put his mind on her’ (taken a liking to her), no one other man would dare have anything to do with her, being afraid of William, for as I already said, Illiam was an astounding man in strength, although he was, as I knew, completely innocent (naïve), and I never heard that he was ‘for the drink’, or making any use of bad words. There were three miles of travail from the village where Illiam lived to Susan’s house, and the road was going over the mountain, but William would be going two or three times a week to visit Susan, no matter what sort of weather there would be.","     Nish, va Illiam sooree inneen ’sy naboonys as er-çhee jannoo poosey ree, as she caillin feer waagh va Susan.

"     One afternoon, there was a mid-week service in the chapel, and any time there would be something in the chapel in the afternoon, after the day’s labour, it would our tradition, sons and farmers’ labourers, to go to the chapel about quarter of an hour before the time of the service, to chat and hear the news. There was fault enough to be found in the tradition, but there was something to be said for it — not often, but at such opportunites, we would have a suitable chance to see each other, because we were living in far-flung places. Now as I said, there was a service in the chapel on Wednesday afternoon, and several of us had gathered together near to the chapel a while before the time.","     Fastyr dy row, va shirveish mean-ny-shiaghtin ayns y chabbal, as traa erbee veagh red ennagh ’sy chabbal ’syn astyr, lurg laboraght yn laa, veagh cliaghtey ain, mec as labreeyn da eirinee, dy gholl gys y chabbal mysh kerroo oor roish traa yn çhirveish, dy ghoaill cowag as clashtyn y naight.

"     It was an icy evening, and there was moonlight, and after we had talked for a while, who did we see coming to us, but William the shepherd! When he came near to us, we all saw that he seemed to be somewhat troubled, and I asked him if anything had happened to the sheep, and he answered — and here for you exactly (are) his own words:","     She fastyr rioeeagh ve, as re-hollys ayn, as lurg dooin v’er haggloo rish tammylt, quoi honnick shin çheet hooin veih’n clieau, agh Illiam yn bochilley!

"     “Nothing, Edward, but do you know this — I saw something terribly strange as I was coming over the ridge of yonder mountain. You know that I’m not a shy man, but when I was coming down that (mountain)side, I came straight into complete darkness, — I couldn’t see my own hand.","     “Cha nel veg, Edard, agh vel fys euish er shoh — honnick mee red quaagh atçhimagh as mish çheet harrish dreeym y clieau shid.

"     I didn’t take fright, and I went through the darkness until I came into the light, then I stood to look behind me, and I saw a black cloud, long and low, as level on its top as a top of a wall or (as) a hedge that had been cut level.","     Cha ren mee goaill aggle, as hie mee roym trooid y dorraghys gys haink mee stiagh ayns y toilshey, eisht hass mee dy yeeaghyn my-chooyl, as honnick mee bodjal doo, liauyr, as injil, cho rea er e vullagh as mullagh voalley [sic] ny as[7] cleiagh v’er ny ghiarrey rea.",[7] as] ‘as’ — superflous here.
"     When I was looking at it, I saw straight away a crowd of people going in procession on the other side of the cloud, only their heads and their shoulders were visible for me, and although they seemed to be close to me, I didn’t recognise any one of them. I saw the people moving forward and the cloud too, and soon it was clear to me that four men at the end of the cloud were carrying a coffin on a bier, and there was one man behind the bier on horseback, and I recognised him straight away — it was Juan Probert mounted on a black horse.

Small indeed that house of Thomas’ was, one of the smallest houses I ever saw in my life, and they said that one afternoon it was, after coming home from his work, the owner Jac the carpenter built that house, and that Thomase was living in it the morning of the next day! At any rate, that is the smallest house I ever saw; a man would reach everything that was in the room without getting up out of his chair, and in the other room, that was doing for a bedroom, there was only a place for a bed.","     Va Thomase baghey ayns thie beg cooyl yn thie-oast Bluebell ayns y valley ainyn.

"     Thomas had been in a few battles, and in one of them, — I don’t know if it was in Waterloo — he lost a piece of bone from the top of his head, but the doctors had done a very good, nice job on the old creature’s head, through putting a silver plate over the hole so that his brains would be visible. I saw the silver plate with my own eyes tens of times, and Thomas would be saying that he would be often without a single penny, bar sixpence a day as a pension (annuity) because he had fought on behalf of his country; but was every quarter (year) he would get the money from Sargeant-Major Evans. The major was a very strange man, but that is another story!","     Va Thomase er ve ayns kuse dy chaggaghyn, as ayns ’nane jeu, — cha s’ ayms my ve ayns Waterloo — chaill meer dy chraue jeh mullagh e ching, agh va ny fir-lhee er n’yannoo startey feer vie yesh er kione yn çhenn chretoor, trooid claare-argid y chur harrish y towl nagh beagh ny h-enneeyn echey ry-akin.

"     Although the old couple were so innocent, they weren’t believers at all, and little thought they had about religion.

"     Thomas would be getting credit on prearranged interest in a small shop, and in one or two of the inns, to wait for his pension day. After reaching the limit of his loan, Thomas and Betsy would be very poor, but the first thing the old soldier would do afterhe had got his money — and he was in this an example to many people today — was to go around to pay his debts, and after that, alas! he and Betsy would spend the rest on drink. But, as I have said, there would be have a shortage for weeks before the pension pay-day, and many’s the skill [ruse] Thomase would perform to get a little drop.","     Veagh Thomase geddyn daill gys sym reaght ro-laue ayns shapp veg, as ayns ’nane ny jees jeh ny thieyn-oastey, dy uirraghtyn rish laa yn argid-bea echey.

"     “I’ll never be without silver”, [the same word is used for money and silver in Manx] said Thomas, and the man extended the drink to him.

"     “I have no brass, but I have silver,” answered Thomas, and he pulled his hat off, and he showed the silver-plate on the top of his head to the innkeeper. That surprised him, and he complained that he was decieved for {once??}.","     “Cha nel prash erbee ayms, agh ta argid ayms,” dreggyr Thomase, as hayrn eh e edd jeh, as yeeagh eh yn claare-argid er mullagh e ching da’n oasteyr.

No one but the mother and the son had heard the spirit, and they hadn’t mentioned a word to the daughter so that she wouldn’t take a fright, because her health was very poor, and they put strict charge on me not to speak to her about the matter, and the mother said:","     She lhiuesyn va’n thie-oast, as v’ad er cheiltyn yn skeeal veih dy-chooilley pheiagh, er-aggle dy jinnagh ee skielley da’n thie as oastys, agh va siyr mooar dy chreck eh orroo.

It was in that room that my husband died about a year ago, and my daughter did so much nursing until her health deteriorated, and in my heart I am afraid that she would, at some sudden time, hear the thing that is our worry, because it would be enough for her life {the end of her ??}, and it doesn’t matter to me if I would be gone from here even tomorrow, if I could get something like a proper price for the building.","     “Shoh myr te,” dreggyr ee dy-fastagh, jeeaghyn hug[13] y ghorrys er aggle dy beagh ee clashtit ec yn inneen, veagh shin clashtyn er[14] ennagh fosley yn dorrys — cha nel glass erbee er — as çhelleeragh jeigh eh ny lurg shen.

I lit the candle quickly and I took a hold of my revolver, because I was fully prepared that I would find out if it was some rogue that was worrying these innocent people, that I would make a few holes in him! But, the next minute, when the door opened, I fell shaking like a leaf, and more like that when I saw the young girl in her nightwear coming straight to my bed, and looking calmly in my eyes, saying, “Are you getting better, dear father?”","     Traa ennagh ny lurg shen heill mee dy row mee clashtyn sheean çheu-mooie jeh’n çhamyr.

"     Although Burgess was a somewhat cruel  man, as I said, he was very fond of his son, and giving him almost more that his fill of luxury, and Burgess’ wife would do that: actually, many people would believe that old Burgess and his wife weren’t wishful for anything else in this life, but the happiness and delight of the boy Hugh.","     Ga dy re dooinney cooid veg dewil va Burgess, myr dooyrt mee, v’eh feer ghraihagh er e vac, as cur bunnys smoo na e haie dasyn dy hoaillidyn, as shen yinnagh Ben Burgess: dy-firrinagh, veagh ymmodee sleih credjal nagh row shenn Burgess as e ven miandagh er red erbee elley ’sy vea shoh, agh maynrys as eunys ny ghuilley Hugh.",
"     Hugh loved dumb living creatures best, and through the kindness of his father and his mother he had many sorts of birds in the house and behind the house — doves, rabbits, a little donkey, and I don’t know how many other things, and the boys of the neighbourhood would be envious of the number of his livestock.","     Bynney lesh Hugh cretooryn bio balloo, as trooid kenjallys e ayrey as e vayrey va ymmodee sorçhyn dy ein echey ’sy thie as cooyl y thie — calmaneyn, conneeyn, assyl veg, as cha ’s ayms cre whilleen dy reddyn elley, as veagh troo er guillyn y naboonys rish earroo e stock-bio.",
"     Hugh would be going to a school that was about a mile from his house, and to avoid going to and fro, he would bring his dinner with him in a little basket to the school. On the other side of the highway from the school, in one of those little houses, you see, a man called Martin was living, who used to earn his means of living — honourable enough as far as I know — by selling nuts, oranges, rock, and things like that, and he would frequent the markets in the towns around about the country.","     Veagh Hugh goll dy schoill va mysh meeiley voish e hie, as dy haghney goll noon as noal, verragh eh e yinnair leshyn ayns baskad veg dys y schoill.

"     Sam had worked diligently to and fro on the hard highways for many years and had grown old, and you know, that ten years is the same as hundred years for a dog. Nevertheless, Sam was twelve years of age, and one day he became very lame, and he couldn’t pull the cart anymore. Sam was an invalid in Martin’s shed for weeks, and Hugh Burgess would go to him with some of his dinner every day he’d be in school, and the the dog and he had become true friends.","     Va Sam er n’obbraghey dy-jeadagh noon as noal er ny raaidyn creoi rish ymmodee bleeantyn as er n’aase shenn, as ta fys ayd, dy vel jeih bleeaney yn un red lesh keead blein da moddey.

"     Martin had no hopes at all that Sam would recover so well as start his work afresh in the cart, and therefore he would give him half his fill of food, and were it not for Hugh Burgess Sam would have atarved long before.","     Cha row jerkallyn erbee ec Martin dy darragh Sam my-laue cho mie as dy ghoaill toshiaght ass-y-noa er e obbyr ’sy chairt, as er-y-fa shen cha derragh eh da lieh e haie dy vee, as er-be son Hugh Burgess veagh Sam er n’gholl neeu foddey-er-dy-henney.",
"     One midday,, when Hugh was bringing some of his dinner to Sam, he saw Martin going to the court with a gun under his arm.

"     Hugh started to cry bitterly, and he begged him if would (could) take Sam home with him, and that permission was given to him quickly, because Martin was glad to get rid of the old dog. Sam was looking as if he would understand the matter between Hugh and Martin, because when his master turned his back and brought the gun to the house, Sam shook his tail, as if a great weight had gone from his mind. Sam had seen a partner or two / many partners shot after becoming lame and failing to pull the cart, but that night Hugh took Sam home, and how great was the effort the old dog on three legs (made) following him!","     Huitt Hugh er keayney dy-sharroo, as ren eh aghin huggey dy gowagh eh Sam marish dy-valley, as va’n kied shen currit da dy-tappee, son by vie lesh Martin geddyn rey rish yn çhenn voddey.

"     Although Hugh’s father and mother were so placid to him, they gave a severe telling-off to the boy for bringing such a big clumsy, hairy and hungry creature near to the house, and Burgess wanted to shoot the dog right away. But Hugh knew about his father’s weak will, and he started crying bitterly and copiously, and finally he got permisson to turn out the little donkey, and give the donkey shed to the dog.","     Ga dy row ayr as moir Hugh cho kiune da, hug ad oghsan gyere da’n ghuilley son cur lesh lheid y cretoor mooar maaigagh, mollagh as accryssagh faggys da’n thie, as by vian lesh Burgess lhiggey yn moddey çhelleeragh.

"     By means of a freat deal of care, kindness, and enough food, Sam took (gained) strength wonderfull, but his foot didn’t get ever get better. Every night, after Hugh had come home from school, Sam would be seen following him lamely and slowly on the road.","     Liorish mooarane kiarail, kenjallys, as bee dy-liooar, ghow Sam niart dy-yindyssagh, agh cha daase e chass ny share rieau.

"     At that time, there was a hansome little rowing boat on the mill pond, but no one had permission to touch er except he who owned it, and the foreman of the will and their families, and Hugh had learnt to row the boat very capably.","     Ec y traa shen, va baatey-ymmyrt beg bwaagh er loghan y wyllin, agh cha row kied ec fer erbee bentyn r’ee er-lhimmey jehsyn by lesh ee, as furriman y wyllin as nyn lught-thieyn, as va Hugh er n’ynsaghey gymmyrt y baatey dy-feer aghtal.",
"     One Summer evening, Burgess, his wife and Hugh to the pond, with Sam walking lamely following them. Hugh wanted to show the father and his mother how capable he was managing to row the boat, but his mother was against it, because it was starting to get dark.","     Fastyr souree dy row, hie Burgess, e ven as Hugh shooyl gys y loghan, as Sam shooyl dy-croobagh g’eiyrt orroo.

"     “Let him go,” said Burgess, and Hugh went easily from the shore. When he was in the middle of eh pond, the old Burgess  watched his son with loving eyes, and he said, “What a wonderful boy that will be, if he come to age.”","     “Lhig yn raad da,” dooyrt Burgess, as hie Hugh dy-aashagh veih’n traie.

"     Hardly were the words out of his mouth, when Hugh lost his grip on the oar, and he fell out of the boat into the deep water. The father and the mother called, out of their minds with fear, but there was no one near to hear and to help them. In the same instant, the old dog jumped into the pond, but his defective leg was preventing him from swimming but slowly. Hugh’s head became visible, and then he went out of sight again, and like that, two or three times, whilst poor Sam was trying his best to go to him.","     S’coan va ny fockleyn ass e veal, tra chaill Hugh e ghreim er y vadjey-raue, as huitt eh magh ass y vaatey stiagh ayns yn ushtey dowin.

"     Then they lost sight of the dog and the boy, and Mrs. Burgess began to rip her clothing, not knowing what to do, but presently they saw Sam’s head above the surface of the water, and he was making for the shore, and pulling something behind him, and seeming to be just like ‘himself’ when he’d be pulling the cart long ago, — his head up, and shaking his ears to drive away the flies.","     Eisht chaill ad shilley er y voddey as er y ghuilley, as ghow Benainster Burgess toshiaght er raipey e h-eaddagh, gyn-yss j’ee c’red v’ee jannoo, agh ny-sheyn, honnick ad kione Sam erskyn eaghtyr yn ushtey, as v’eh jannoo son y traie, as tayrn red ennagh ny yei, as jeeaghyn dy ve kiart goll-rish-hene tra veagh eh tayrn y chairt foddey-er-dy-henney, — e chione heose, as craa e chleayshyn dy eiyrt ersooyl ny quaillaghyn.",

"     After thay had got the boy on dry land Hugh was, for a long, long time, coming to his senses, and Sam was, were anyone to take notice of him, after he had shaken the water once or twice out of his long, hairy, ear, keeping watch over on Hugh’s revival just as anxiously as anyone else.

"     They brought a barrow from the mill to carry him, but Sam died before the morning. Hugh almost broke his heart for his dog, and the neighbours were saying that they didn’t know which of them was more evident in Burgess — his joy for the deliverance of his son, or his sorrow for Sam’s death.","     Hug ad lhieu barrey veih’n wyllin dy ymmyrkey eh, agh hooar Sam baase roish y voghrey.
