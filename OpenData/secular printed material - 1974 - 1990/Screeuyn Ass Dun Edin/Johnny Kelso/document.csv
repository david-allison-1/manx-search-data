","Last week I went to visit the Isle of Arran in Clyde to colleect placenames, and when I was there I met an old man who was living in a village called ‘Shiskine’. ",[1] hie ... enmyn-buill y hymsaghey] evidently intended for ‘went .. to collect placenames’. [hie ... dy hymsaghey enmyn-buill] would be expected here.
"She Jimmy Kelso yn ennym ersyn as v’eh mysh kiare feed bleeaney [sic] dy eash, as dinsh eh dooys[2] yn skeeal shoh:","Jimmy Kelso is his name and he was about eighty years of age, and he told this story to me:",[2] dooys] ‘to me’ (emphatic form). Unstressed [dou] would be expected here.
Roish yn Chied Chaggey v’eh jannoo shirveish ayns y cheshaght-chaggee Ghoaldagh as ec y traa v’ayn she ayns Catterick v’eh[3]. ,Before the First War he was doing service in the British army and at the time he was in Catterick. ,[3] she ayns Catterick v’eh] ‘he was in Catterick’ (with fronting of ‘in Catterick’ giving ‘In Catterick (and not somewhere else) he was’.

See also [holt]._ftn5
[5] pryssoon hidooragh] ‘soldiers’ prison’, ‘military prison’. The lenition of [sidooragh] must be because the writer here treats [pryssoon] as a feminine noun, as is the usual practice in Scottish Gaelic for words with initial [P], although later in the article it is treated as masculine."
"She pryssoon v’eh cadjin yn dorrys sniessey da’n phryssoon elley[6] as tra v’eh ayns shen, cheayll eh dy row Arranagh elley ayns y nah phryssoon[7], as hooar eh kied dy gholl lesh shilley er.","[meaning obscure, see note below] and when he was there he heard that another Arran man was in the neighbouring prison, and he got permission to go visit him.","[6] She pryssoon v’eh cadjin yn dorrys sniessey da’n phryssoon elley] — ‘It was a prison normal the nearest door to the other prison’ — The intended meaning seems to be something like [liorish va pryssoon chadjin] ‘beside it was a normal prison’, or ‘there was a neighbouring prison that was a normal prison’, or [va pryssoon naboo ayn va ny phryssoon cadjin].
[7] y nah phryssoon] ‘the second prison’ / ‘the next prison’ — [nah] is 
used to mean ‘next’ as in ‘next in order’, but not ‘next to’. [y phryssoon naboo] ‘the neighbouring prison’, or [y phryssoon elley] ‘the other prison’ would be expected here.
