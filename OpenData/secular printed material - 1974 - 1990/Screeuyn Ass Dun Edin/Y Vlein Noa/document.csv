There were about twenty men at this cèilidh and there were Irish dances going on and there were a lot of songs in Manx heard. I enjoyed the cèilidh immeasurably and I like seeing that it is the custom of the Peel Gaels to hold such a thing every Saturday night. ",

The children are between three years and eight years of age, and it is about four female school teachers that are in it for the teaching of the children and little phrases to help them hold the Scottish Gaelic in their minds. Last Christmas they made a play about the birth of Jesus Christ in Scottish Gaelic and it was a great success. Can we establish such a thing in the Isle of Man?",[1] y Ghaidhlig] {a’ Ghàidhlig} ‘Scottish Gaelic’.

So it was in memory of him that something in Manx will be put into the next number of “Tocher” (the journal of the School) that will be ready this coming March. There will be copies of it available at 25p each (including postage) from me at 27 George Square, Edinburgh 8.",[2] row] original gives [ren]
