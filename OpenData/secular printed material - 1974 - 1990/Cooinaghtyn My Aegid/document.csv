"     Tra vrie Juan y Geill orrym roie-raa y screeu da’n lioar shoh, va yindys mooar orrym cre oddins gra veagh cooie feeu jeh lheid yn obbyr. ","     When John Gell asked me to write a foreword for this book, I was perplexed as to what I would (could) say that would suitably worthy of such work. ",
"Son lesh cre’n cairys foddym pene insh diu, y lhaihder, mychione dooinney va g’ynsaghey [da] studeyryn ny Gailckey eer roish my row mee ruggit, as mish my yoarree nagh daink dy vaghey ayns Ellan Vannin agh tammylt beg er-dy-henney? ","For with what justice can I myself tell to you, reader, about a man who was teaching students of Manx even before I was born, with me being a foreigner who only came to live in the Isle of Man a little while ago?",
"     Agh ta kianglaghyn mooarey eddyr Juan y Geill as mish, hoshiaght er-y-fa dy ren shinyn ny-neesht Gailck y ynsaghey ayns Sostyn.","     But there are great bonds between John Gell and I, firstly because we both learnt learnt Manx in England.",
"Jir y chuse smoo dy ynseydee ny laghyn shoh dy vel feme oc er brastyllyn Gailckagh as loayrtee ny Gailckey son dy ynsaghey yn ghlare as ish y chliaghtey, as dy brieagh [sic] shiu jeu, yiarragh ad nagh voddagh ad sheiltyn kys ’sy theihll ynseeagh ad nyn fegooish agh eshyn ynseeys y Ghailck foddey ersooyl veih’n cheer aynjee t’ee goll er loayrt, shimmey doilleeid yiow eh; as cha nel fockley-magh ny Gailckey agh unnane jeu! ","Most students these days will say that they have need of Manx classes and speakers of Manx to study the language and to practice it, and if you were to ask them, they would say that they could not imagine how in the world they would study without them but [as for] he who learns Manx far away from the country in which it is being spoken, many is the difficulty he will find; and the pronunciation of Manx is only one of them! ",
"Tra va Juan y Geill gynsaghey Gailck, cha row ee cheet er e hoshiaght as bishaghey myr t’ee ec y traa t’ayn, as stiark caarjyn ny Gailckey va ry-gheddyn ’sy lhing shen.","When John Gell was learning Manx, it wasn’t progressing and increasing as it is at the current time, and how few friends of Manx were to be found in that era.",
"Gyn scansh da shoh, cha lhig eh da hene cree y choayl; er-yn-oyr dy row gennid fockleyryn ayn, begin dasyn, gollrhym pene, chaglym focklyn veih ny teksyn lhaih eh as eisht croo assdaue yn fockleyr echey hene - obbyr liauyr agh foaysagh erskyn towse, eer da studeyryn yn lhing ain hene.","Regardless of this, he didn’t allow himself to lose heart; because there was a scarcity of dictionaries, he had to, similar to I, collect words from the texts he read and then create from them his own dictionary – a long job, but immeasurabley beneficial, even to students of our own era.",
"Cha nhyrrys dy chossin eh tushtey cho dowin as fondagh jeh chengey ny mayrey e henn-ayraghyn. Ayns Mannin v’eh jeant mooar jeh myr fer ynsee as myr reagheyder ny h-earishlioar Coraa Ghailckagh (1951- 57), as haink eh dy ve unnane jeh’n phossan beg shen dy gheiney as mraane dauesyn ta shin ooilley kianglt bwooise son freayll bio yn Ghailck car ny bleeantyn doillee shen. ","It’s no wonder that he gained knowledge so deep and effectual, of the mother-tongue of his ancestors. In the Isle of Man he was cherished as a teacher and as organiser (editor ??) of the journal Coraa Ghailckagh (Manx Voice) (1951- 57), and he became one of that small party of men and women to whom we are all grateful for keeping alive Manx during those difficult years.",
"Ta kiangley elley eddyr ain myrgeddin, er-yn-oyr dy nee voishyn hooar mee tushtey[-]ny[-]Gailckey choloayrtyssagh, eer roish my daink mee ny whaail son y chied cheayrt! Son dy nee veih’n lioar echey “Conversational Manx” dynsee mee yn Gailck y 'ockley-magh as b’leayr dou cre cho ymmydoil ta’n lioar shoh er ve dou tra ren mee my chied eab dy loayrt ayns y Ghailck. ","There is a connection between us too, because it from him that I gained knowledge of conversational Manx, even before I met him for the first time! Because it was from his book “Conversational Manx” that I learnt to pronounce Manx and it was clear to me how useful this book has been to me when I made my first attempt to speak in Manx.",
"Ny-yeih, cha nee mish my lomarcan ren soo dy vie [sic] jeh obbyr Yuan y Geill: gagh blein, ayns brastyllyn ny Gailckey fud ny h-ellan shoh, ta kuse vooar[1] dy ynseydee, chammah shenn as aeg, jannoo ymmyd j’ee as liorish shen bishaghey yn Gha1lck oc hene. Agh ga dy vel ad son shickyrys cur enney er ennym yn ughtar, s’beg ta’n fys oc er y dooinney hene as e vea. ","Nevertheless, it is not only I who imbibed well of the work of John Gell: every year, in Manx classes throughout this island, there are a large quantity of students, both old and young, making use of it and by that developing their own Manx. But although they certainly recognise the name of the author, how little they know about the man himself and his life.","[1] kuse vooar] ‘large quantity’ —Cregeen defines [kuse] as ‘a quantity’ and Kelly J as ‘a large quantity’, although in Classical Manx and Late Manx it most often means ‘a small quantity’."
"Shen-yn-oyr nee [sic] adsyn as paart dy Ghailck oc hannah geill jeean y choyrt da’n lioar shoh; aynjee lhaihee ad mychione yn aegid jeh doomney ta nish, gyn scansh da fastid e ambee, coontit mastey ayraghyn ny chengey Vanninagh. ","That is the reason that those who know some Manx already will give keen observance to this book; in which they will read about the youth of a man who is now, regardless of the modesty of his character, considered amongst the parents [or, ‘fathers’] of the Manx tongue. ",
"Agh cha row eh fo’n ughtar dy beagh e lioar jeh [feeu] toilchinys lettyragh erbee, as she jeh yioin dy chooney lesh yn ynseydagh t’eh er screeu yn chied ayrn er aght aashagh, choud’s ta aght-screeuee yn nah ayrn beggan s’doillee[2]. ","But the author did not intend that his book would of [worthy of] any literary merit, and it is intentionally to assist the student that he has written the first part in an easy way, whilst the style of writing of the second part is a little more difficult.","[2] beggan s’doillee] [beggan] here is evidently intended to mean ‘a little bit’ (see [red beg], and not [hardly any] as it would be understood in Classical Manx & Late Manx. [s’doillee] is attributive, the appropriate predicative form [ny s’doillee] would be expected here."
"Erskyn ooilley va’n lioar er ny screeu taitnys y chur da’n lhaihder cadjin, as myr shen ta mee geearree erriu nish y lhaihder, taitnys, soylley as foays mooar choud’s lhaihys shiu yn skeeal jeh aegid nyn garrey Yuan y Geill.[3] ","Above all, the book was written to provide enjoyment to the ordinary reader, and so I entreat you now, reader, pleasure, enjoyment and great benefit whilst you will read the story of the youth of our friend John Gell.  ",[3] This sentence is evidently missing some words.
"Rere aghin yn ughtar ta mee er chiartaghey marranyn erbee [sic] ta mee er chronnaghey ayns teks ny lioar shoh[4] as ta kuse veg dy chaghlaaghyn gram­meydagh er ve jeant aym; agh oardrailys[5] as cohoiaghey[6] ny raaghyn ta mee dy kiarailagh er naagail gyn caghlaa, son dy ’reayll blass chengey yn ughtar. ","In accordance with the request of the author, I have corrected any errors I have spotted in the text of this book and a small mount of gramatical variations (changes) have been made by me; but the order and context of the phrases I have intentionally left without change, for to keep ‘the flavour of the author’s tongue’ (‘to maintain the author’s style of language’). ","[4] teks ny lioar shoh] ‘the text of this book’. Treating ‘lioar’ is a feminine noun, the writer is using the [ny + unlenited feminine noun] form of genitive construction (not at all unusual in revived Manx of the late 20th Century).
[5] Oardrailys] ‘order’, see also [oardagh].
[6] cohoiaghey] unknown word. Here taken to mean ‘context’."

     SHE MISH Juan y Geill ta loayrt riu as ta mee Manninagh kiart dy liooar agh cha noddym gra dy nee Manninagh dooie mish er yn oyr va mee ruggit as troggit harrish yn ushtey. ,"     It is I, John Gell who is speaking to you, and I am a Manxman right enough but I cannot say that I am a native-born Manxman because I was born and reared across the water. ",
"     Ta feallagh ayn as yinnagh ad gra, my ta dooinney ruggit ayns Sostyn, she Sostnagh eh; mie dy liooar, agh cre mysh ny Chinese ta ruggit er yn Ellan er y gherrit, vel adsyn Manninee?","     There are people who would say that if a man is born in England, he is an Englishman; fair enough, but what of the Chinese born on the Island lately, are they Manx?",
"Cha jeanym credjal eh, cha nel eh kiart, as er y fa shen foddym gra dy nee Manninagh mish er yn oyr va my voir as m'ayr ny neesht ruggit as troggit ayns shoh er yn ellan, as ny smoo na shen, va my hennayr as my hennayraghyn rish keeadyn dy vleeantyn cummal as gobbraghey y thalloo ec Ballakilpheric ayns Skeerey Chreest Rosien ’sy Jiass, as ve ooilley Gailck va goll er loayrt ayns lhing my yishag-wooar as my warree. ","I won’t believe it, it's not right, and therefore I can say that I am Manx because my mother and father were both born and bred here on the Island, and more than that, my grandfather and ancestors for hundreds of years held and worked the land at Ballakilpheric in the parish of Rushen in the south and it was all Manx Gaelic that was spoken in the days of my grandparents. ",
"As er my hon hene foddym loayrt, lhaih, as screeu ’sy Gailck va ynsit dou lioroosyn loayrt chengey ny mayrey voish y clean. Atreih! t' ad ooilley ersooyl nish. ","For my own part, I can speak, read and write the Manx as it was taught to me by those who spoke the mother-tongue from the cradle, alas! they are all gone now. ",
     Lhig dou ginsh diu kys haink eh gy kione dy row mee ruggit ayns Liverpool; ,     Let me tell you how it came about that I was born in Liverpool. ,
"va daa vac ec my hen­ nayr as va my yishag y fer s’aa, er y fa shen tra daag eh yn schoill, hie eh dys keird myr prindeis seyr-thie ec Purt Chiarn rish shiaght bleeaney as tra va'n prindeis jeant echey cha row obbyr dy liooar er yn Ellan as b’egin da goll ersooyl dys Lancashire. ","My grandfather had two sons and my father was the younger, therefore when he left school, he went to trade as an apprentice joiner in Port Erin for seven years and when the apprenticeship was completed there was not enough work on the Island and he had to go away to Lancashire. ",
"     Ec y traa shen, kiare feed blein as queig er dy henney, va traaghyn creoi goll ’syn Ellan, gyn monney obbyr as dyn monney argid, as b'egin da keeadyn dy gheiney aegey faagail cheer nyn ghooie as goll ersooyl dy hirrey bioys noa ayns thalloo joarree, dys Canada, America, Australia as New Zealand, as ymmodee fir elley shiaulley noon as noal ayns lhongyn er yn ’aarkey mooar. ","     At that time, eighty-five years ago, times were hard on the Island, not much work and not much money and hundreds of young men had to leave their native land and go away to seek a new life in a strange land to Canada, America, Australia and New Zealand, and many others sailing hither and thither in ships on the great ocean. ",
"     Shen yn aght lesh Manninec eisht, t’ad scarrit as skealt harrish eaghtyr y theihll; t’ad ry-gheddyn ayns dagh valley as ard-valley er feiy ny cruinney. ","     That's the way with Manxmen then, they are scattered and spread over the surface of the earth; they are to be found in every town and city throughout the universe. ",
"     Agh shegin dou gra shoh, s’anvennick yiow shiu fer jeu, boght, femoil, as arkyssagh, as cre’n fa?· ","     But I must say this, seldom will you find one of them poor or in need or distress, and why? ",
"     Er yn oyr va laueyn mie ec ny Manninee ayns laghyn t’er n’goll shaghey, v’ad fir cheirdee mie as jeidagh, gobbraghey dy creoi as dy kinjagh, agh erskyn ooilley va’n chooid smoo jeu deiney ynrick as feeudagh, oney, firrinagh as sheeyit.","     Because Manxmen had good hands in days gone by; they were good and diligent tradesmen working hard and steadily, but above all the greater part of them were upright and worthy men, simple, true and sober. ",
"     Er feiy ny cruinney va’n Manninagh er chosney arrym, foayr as goo-mie. Vodmayd gra wheesh mychione Manninee aegey ec y traa t’ayn jiu? ","     All over the world the Manxman has earned respect, favour and good report. Can we say as much about young Manxmen of today? ",
"     Shen myr ve eisht, kys va mish my lhiannoo ayns Sostyn, tra lhisins v’er ve ayns Ellan Vannin. ",     So it was then that I was a child in England when I should have been in the Isle of Man. ,
"     Va my voir ruggit as troggit ec Ballakaighan ayns Skeerey Cairbre, as va’n ayr as shuyr shinney eek baghey ayns shen derrey va mish jeih bleeaney d’eash. ","     My mother was born and reared at Ballakeighan in the parish of Arbory, and her father and elder sister lived there until I was about ten years old. ",
"     Myr shoh, dagh vlein’ sy tourey veagh my vummig as e paitchyn ceau laghyn feailley ec Ballakaighan, as cre cho maynrey as va ny laghyn feailley shen! ","     So, each year in the summer, mother and her children would spend holidays at Ballakeighan, and oh! how happy were those days! ",
     Va Ballakaighan dy firrinagh ‘Niau er y Thalloo’ dooys ayns m’aegid - er chosh dy· moghey 'sy voghrey as ersooyl er dreeym y chabbyl mooar marish ny deiney gys y lheeannee dy gheddyn stiagh yn traagh. ,"     Ballakeighan was truly ""heaven on earth"" to me in my youth - up early in the morning and away on the back of the cart horse with the men to get to the meadow to get in the hay. ",
"     Ny keayrtyn sheese er traie ny marrey, as cloie ’syn ushtey ec y trooan; ayns y ‘haggard’ marish my huyr chaglyn oohyn-kiark ny mast' ny lossreeyn, as ayns towlyn ’sy choonlagh, eisht chymsaghey blaaghyn ’sy vagheryn as ayns ny cleighyn. ","     Sometimes down on the sea shore and playing in the water at the stream; in the stackyard with my sister gathering hen's eggs among the weeds and in holes in the straw, then picking flowers in the fields and the hedges. ",
"     S’yn astyr, veagh shin ooilley goaill nyn aash ayns y garey, jeeaghyn er ny ‘waggonettes’ cheet harrish y cronk veih Purt Chiarn as goll shaghey Ballakaighan ayns bodjallyn dy yoan! V’ad goaill ny Goaldee as Joarreeyn gys Doolish reesht. ","     In the evenings, we would all take our ease in the garden, watching the waggonettes come over the hill from Port Erin and going past Ballakeighan in clouds of dust! They were taking visitors and strangers back to Douglas. ",
"     Cha row ‘tar-mac’ er ny raaidyn ec y traa shen, as ayns y gheurey v'ad laagh as ushtey as 'sy tourey va d chooilley nhee coodit lesh joan. ","     There was no ‘tar-mac’ on the roads at that time, and in winter they were mud and water, and in summer everything was covered with dust. ",
"     Cha naik mee rieau ‘carr-motor’ ’syn Ellan tra va mee aeg, agh ve ‘steam engines’ lesh queeylyn mooar yiarn, as va feallagh g’enmys ad ‘Mwyllyn y Jouyl’ ayns Gailck. ","     I never saw a motor car in the Island when I was young but there were steam engines with large iron wheels, and people were calling them in Manx “The Devil’s Mill.” ",
"     Fy-yerrey haink yn laa dooin dy gholl ersooyl thie reesht harrish yn ushtey, as va jeir, coe as keayney goll son tammylt beg, agh v’ad jarroodit tra va’n cloan as cooid as bundeilyn currit ayns y caart lajer lesh y cabbyl mooar dy gholl gys y ‘stashoon’ ec Ballabeg. Va’n caart mooar gollrish fainagh reeoil dooinyn! ","     Eventually the day came for us to go away home again across the water, and there were tears, lamentation and crying for a little while, but they were soon forgotten when the family and the luggage and bundles were put in the strong cart with the big horse to go to the station at Ballabeg; the big cart was like a royal coach to us! ",
"     Cre’n taitnys yindyssagh ta’n lhiannoo feddyn ayns reddyn oney as cadjin, gollrish roie cass-rooisht er genniagh traie ny marrey, ayns geaishtagh rish cloie yn ushtey 'sy trooan, ayns soar millish y traagh noa­ giarrit, ayns arrane ny h-ushaghyn as chiass ny greiney lurg frass dy ’liaghey. ","     What wonderful delight the child finds in simple ordinary things, such as running barefoot on the sand on the sea shore, in listening to the bubbling of the water in the stream, in the sweet smell of the new mown hay, in the song of the birds and the warmth of the sun after a shower of rain.",
"     Eunyssyn erskyn towse tra va shin aeg, agh atreih! ta’n traa getlagh as foddey ro leah ta shin deiney, aegey as mraane aegey, as ta reddyn er chaghlaa – ta’n obbeeys ersooyl, ersooyl lesh ny ferrishyn er son dy bragh!","     Delights beyond measure when we were young, but alas, time flies, and far too soon we are young men and young women and things have changed, the magic has gone, gone with the fairies for ever!",
"     Lurg baase my hennayr, va my naunt pooist rish dooinney eirinagh as hie ad dy chummal ayns Ballahallagh. Myr shoh, veih yn traa shen gys y traa va mee pooist meehene, veign ceau my laghyn feailley maroo ayns Ballahallagh as marish mooinjer elley ayns buill elley.","     After the death of my grandfather, my aunt was married to a farmer and they went to live in Ballasalla. So, from that time to the time I was married myself, I would spend holidays with them in Ballasalla and with other relatives in other places.",
"     Ny keayrtyn va mee marish my voomJer ec Ballagilley, thie eirinys mooar as aalin va bentyn da Ard Schoill Ree Illiam. Atreih! va’n slane voayl lhieggit sheese tra v’ad troggal y phurt aeroil ec Runnysvie.","     Sometimes I was with my people at Ballagilley, a large and beautiful farm house which belonged to King William's College. Alas, the whole place was pulled down when they were building the Airport at Ronaldsway.",
"     Va daa vac as daa inneen ayns shen ec Ballagilley as va'n inneen shinney feer ghraihagh er ny cretooryn, er-lheh ny kirree. Shimmey’n oie feayr as dorraghey ta mee er n’gholl magh maree gys y soalt yiarn lesh londeyr as bunneenyn dy choonlagh dy hroggal fastee son ny kirree as nyn eaynin, as boteil dy vainney son yn eayn meig.","     They were two sons and two daughters at Ballagilley, and the elder daughter was very fond of animals, especially the sheep. Many's the night, cold and dark, I have gone out with her to the iron barn with a lantern and bales of straw to build a shelter for the sheep and lambs, and a bottle of milk for the “meig” lamb.",
"     Er y raad mooar eddyr y Phurt Aeroil as y raad gys Ard Schoill Ree Illiam, va thie elley lhieggit sheese - toor mooar kiare-corneilagh as garey marish, lesh boallaghyn ard mygeayrt. Va’n sleih g’enmys eh “Quayle’s Folly”. ","     On the high road between the Airport and the road to King William’s College there was another house pulled down - a large four-square tower and a garden alongside, with high walls round about it; people called it Quayle’s Folly.",
"Ayns y toor er laare y ghrunt va’n fainagh poste freaylt, va roie eddyr Ballacashtal as Doolish dagh laa roish va’n raad-yiarn foshlit, as er yn nah laare va ooilley yn eilley-chabbyl as stoo elley, eisht er yn trass laare va shamyr-vaghee son y dooinney-varkiagh. ","In the tower on the ground floor the post coach was kept which ran from Castletown to Douglas daily before the railway was opened, and on the second floor all the harness and other things, and then on the third floor there was a living room for the coachman.  ",
"     Va mish ’sy chamyr shen bleeantyn er dy henney as hooar mee ayns shen ayns culleig ’sy corneil greeishyn follit! Va yindys mooar orrym, agh cha row rieau caa ayin dy gheddyn magh c’raad v’ad goll as cre’n fa. ",     I was in that room years ago and I found in a corner cupboard a secret staircase! I was mystified but I never had a chance to find out where it led or for what purpose. ,
"     Shen myr ve eisht, va mee cheet harrish dys yn Ellan tra erbee veagh y caa aym, son va mee feer ghraihagh urree as er dy chooilley nhee bentyn da cheer my hennayraghyn as daase y ghraih shen lesh ny bleeantyn derrey b’ione mie dooys nagh beign dy bragh jeant magh derrey hooar me obbyr er yn Ellan as oddins cheet harrish as cummal ayns shoh lesh my vooinjer-hene. ","     So it was then, I was coming over to the Island whenever I had the opportunity, for I loved it and everything connected with the land of my fathers, and that love grew with the years until I knew well that would never be satisfied until I found work on the Island and I could come over to live here with my own people. ",
     Agh atreih! Cha row shen dy ve derrey va ym­modee bleeantyn elley er n’gholl shaghey. ,"     But alas, that was not to be until many more years had passed. ",
"     ’Sy vlein nuy keead jeig as jeih va shin baghey ec West Kirby, as roish goll dy schoill dagh voghrey va mee cooney lesh creckedeyr-bainney er y ca art goaill bainney as oohyn er ny thieyn. ","     In the year nineteen ten we were living at West Kirby, and before going to school each morning I was helping a milk-man on the cart taking milk and eggs to the houses. ",
"     Un laa ’sy vee Boaldyn va dooiney-seyr dy row shassoo ec e ghorrys as vrie eh jeem, “Nod oo lhaih, Johnnie bhoy?” “Dy jarroo foddym,” dreggyr mish as yeeagh eh dou yn pabyr niaght as honnick mee ny focklyn shoh ayns lettyryn mooar as dhoo, TA’N REE MARROO, DY VODDEY BEAYN YN REE. Va’n·Ree Edard yn chiaghtoo er n’gheddyn baase as va’n mac echey George yn Ree noa. ","     One day in May there was a certain gentleman standing at his door and he asked me, “Can you read,. Johnny boy?” “Of course I can,” I replied, and he showed me the newspaper and I saw these words in big black letters, THE KING IS DEAD, LONG. LIVE·THE KING. King Edward the seventh had died and his son George was the new king.",
,,
"     Ny s’anmee ‘sy tourey shen chossyn mee ynnyd seyr ec yn ard schoill, agh 'sy vee cheddin daag shin West Kirby as hie shin dys croit veg faggys da Purt Ellesmere, as va shen mysh hoght meeley jeig er­ sooyl. ","     Later that summer I won a free place at the Grammar School, but in the saine month we left West Kirby and went to a little croft near Ellesmere Port, and that was about eighteen miles away.",
"     Nish va doilleeid ain! Lhisin goll dys yn ard schoill ny dyn dy gholl? Fy yerrey va reaghit lhisin goll, agh atreih, va foast doilleeid elley! ","     Now we were in a dilemma! Should I go to the high school or not. Eventually it was settled that I should go, but, Oh dear, there was still another difficulty! ",
"     Cha row train veih Purt Ellesmere roshtyn West Kirby roish nuy er y chlag 'sy voghrey, as va'n ynrican aght elley dy hooyl daa veeley harrish ny magheryn dys y raad yiarn ec Capenhurst. ",     There was no train from Ellesmere Port arriving at West Kirby before nine o'clock in the morning; the only alternative was to walk two miles over the fields to the railway at Capenhurst. ,
"     Nish, va’n jurnaa shoh coontit foddey rouyr son guilley beg dy yannoo ayns y dorraghys, feayraght as fliugh-niaghtee ayns y geurey. ","     Now this journey was considered far too much for a little boy to make in the dark, cold and sleet in the winter. ",
     Myr shoh b’egin dou goaill aaght marish caarjyn ayns West Kirby voish Mean-ouyr gys yn Ollick. ,     So I had to lodge with friends in West Kirby from September until Christmas. ,
,,
"     Ec y toshiaght va mee kiart dy liooar agh lurg tammylt va mee currit gys shamyr-chadlee ec mullagh y thie, as ve feayr atchimagh ayns shen!","     At first I was right enough, but after a while I was put to a bedroom at the top of the house and it was terribly cold there! ",
"     Dy yannoo reddyn ny smessey, va dooinney aeg ’sy chamyr cheddin mysh queig bleeaney as feed d'eash. Va mee beggan agglagh jeh, agh ec y traa cheddin va mee soiaghey beg jeh; ","     To make things worse there was a young man in the same room about twenty-five years of age. I was a little afraid of him, but at the same time I despised him. ",
"va beeal broghe echey as ny keayrtyn yinnagh eh cheet thie er-meshtey, as va jough lajer red ennagh nagh bione dou.

Also, he was smoking a cigarette with the flame of a candle by his bed; many a time I could not sleep fearing he would put the house on fire. ",

,"We went to the Empire Exhibition in Glasgow, and our little girl was five years of age at the time. She was enchanted by the dwarfs in their fairy houses and the 'Big Dipper'! She was crying and begging me to take her for a ride on it! ",

",     In ‘Cooinaghtyn my Aegid’ I mentioned that the Manx Bible was given to me and that was the way I began to learn the mother tongue but there was another reason; at the Empire Exhibition there was a ‘clachan’ (a few rough thatched houses) and as folk were going into them they were welcomed by a lovely young lady speaking in Scots Gaelic. ,

Go on and learn it while there are people speaking it.” I was truly ashamed hearing so much Scots Gaelic being spoken around me, and I promised that sweet young woman to do my best to learn our own Gaelic. ",

It was a fine warm day and we were perspiring as we walked over the hill to the farm house on the Island. After we had eaten our sandwiches, I went with my brother-in­ law to have a look at the old lighthouses. At that time the island belonged to a Mr Haigh from Huddersfield! ",

There was only another man and myself with the ambulance, and really there should have been another man to keep watch on the woman inside, because I and the other fellow were busy enough. The fog was so thick that we could not see across the road and the roads were dangerous with frozen snow, and worse than all, lights were not allowed in war time, except for three, little slits. ",

I did not like the idea of acting as midwife at all! Anyway, we reached Chester safely and the pregnant woman was smiling and thankful; indeed we were all thankful to get a cup of tea in the warmth of the hospital for a while before going home again. ",

But, at that time, there was not much attention given to the Gaelic and we made little progress. Seldom did anyone learn enough to speak it, and the old Manx speakers were dying one after the other, and I was losing heart, then, after my own wife died, I did not pay much attention to the Manx either. ",
