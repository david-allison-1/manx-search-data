WHERE HAVE ALL THE MANXMEN GONE ?,,

","At the  present time, if you speak to any young  police officer, especially in Douglas, you will be amazed to hear his accent! You would think that you are listening to Z-Cars on the television! Once upon a time almost every police officer was a native Manx person and had a very Manx accent, but now I that that all the young police come from England. How has this come to be? Are the young Manx refusing to enter into that service, or is it official policy not to encourage Manx people to be police officers? ",[1] Z-Cars] — a TV police drama set in a fictional area of Merseyside.
"Er lhiam dy vel shoh cowrey elley jeh'n aght ta reddyn caghlaa ayns Mannin as jeh’n aght ta shin cheet dy ve ny smoo as ny smoo Sostnagh!

Maybe it is better for the police not to be Manx because the Manx are all related to each other! In the old days even my own grandfather and all his brothers were directing the police in this isalnd, and they were doing the job well too, with all their Manx coworkers. ",
,"There is a Gaelic proverb which runs, “If you put a Manxman on a spit over an open fire you will always find another Manxman willing to turn him until he’s done.”[2]","[2] This sentence appears in the original piece, but in English only."
"Cre’n fa eisht, ta shin goaill stiagh ooilley nyn boleenee aegey voish Sostyn?","Why then, are we taking in all young police from England?",

According to Mr Moore, there was an Irishman present and he didn’t understand those words at all! No wonder at all!",[3] ny hrooid] ‘through it’ — [trooid] ‘through’ would be expected

No wonder the poor Irishman  wouldn’t understand the words ‘faoi-thalamb’ as they are pronounced by an English-speaking Manx person!",[4] goll y ’ockley magh] goll er fockley magh

Naturally, we were talking in Manx all the time. It was a fine sunny, hot, beautiful afternoon, and I couldn’t but think about the old people who used to live at Eairy Vane years ago. All their daily lives would be have been lived through Manx alone, without a word of English at all. What a pity it is indeed that there isn’t any place left in the Isle of Man now where people who are yet learning the tongue could visit native speakers where the right accent would be able to be heard and words to be heard that they wouldn’t recognise. The Irish and the Scottish have good luck indeed because there are such houses in their countries and native Gaelic speakers still living in them!",
SKEEAL HARRY BODDAGH,HARRY BOYDE’S STORY,

The man was buried in the graveyard at the old church. A while after, the woman remarried another man and eventually he died too and he was buried in the graveyard at the new church, close to Ballaugh itself. One day the woman went to visit his grave in the new graveyard and when she was there she met an old Man who knew Manx and the old man new her well and knew that she got all the money she had from the first man, but that the grave of the first man was left abandoned and forgotten close to the old church. “Why are you standing there looking at the grave of  your second husband?” said the old man, “Go to the old church and put a stone on the grave of the man you got all the money from.”",aa

As for myself, I won’t every forget the nice old man. Although he didn’t have this world’s wealth he was wealthier than many ‘rich’ Manx people that there are now, because he had the Mother Tongue (Manx) and happiness in his heart. I went to his burial and it was completely in Manx, in the new church at Ballaugh, with Reverend William Kelly and the Reverend Canon C. A. Cannan taking the service. Many Manx people went home that day with heavy hearts, thinking about their dear friend who they would never see again in this world.","[5] oaye] oaie

Bless me! Didn’t anyone tell the poor man that there are two official tongues in the Isle of Man and that we have a Prayer Book and Bible in the mother tongue (Manx)? Doesn’t the bishop know that English is a foreign tongue in Mann’s churches, not Manx! The English think that their tongue is the only tongue in the World. Who was it, once upon a time, who said “God is an Englishman?” An Englishman, no doubt! I’m not against everything English, but as an old native speaker said once, “There are English people and they are good, but there are other English people and they are not as good!”","[9] goll y jannoo] goll er jannoo

","George Broderick wrote to me an official letter from the Board of Taxes in Manx a while ago and naturally I answered it in the same tongue, my natural tongue and the tongue I prefer, the other official language of this Island. I have heard from many people that work in the same place as George that Manx amazes and enrages those he works for! He was like a man prodding an ant nest! “It is English that we use in this office,” they said. They made George make a translation of all that we had written and the poor man did that. Once upon a time in Tynwald a certain member spoke some Manx and Mr Hugh MacLeod answered in Scottish Gaelic and it was put “out of order”! English is the official language in Tynwald too, I think! ",
,"Those who seek to revive Manx must never forget that the revival of the language is a political matter, not a cultural one and only directives from a nationally-minded Manx Government will ensure any sort of aid or assistance for the language. The Civil Ser­vice carries out the instructions of the govern­ment of the day.",
