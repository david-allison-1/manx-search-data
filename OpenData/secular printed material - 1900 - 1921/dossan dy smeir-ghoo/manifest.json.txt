  "notes": "Morrison writes: {This story is the Manx variation of a very ancient folk-tale which occurs in almost every language. Jacobs, in his \u201CCeltic Fairy Tales,\u201D mentions parallels in Irish, Scotch, English (\u201CThe Old Woman and her Pig\u201D) German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Bengali, and refers to suggestions that its origin is probably to be traced back to some religious ceremonial in early times. A similar version of the tale is known in the North of the Island, but \u201Cwinter branch\u201D is substitued for \u201C\u201Dbonny bunch of blackberries,\u201D and the tale is named \u201CSkeeal y Vangan Gheuree.\u201D (The Tale of the Winter\u2019s Branch). Mr Roeder gives a South-side variant in \u201CYn Lioar Manninagh\u201D vol. III. Pt IV.}",
