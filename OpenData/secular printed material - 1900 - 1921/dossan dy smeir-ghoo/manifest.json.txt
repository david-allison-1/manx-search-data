	"notes": "Morrison writes: {This story is the Manx variation of a very ancient folk-tale which occurs in almost every language. Jacobs, in his “Celtic Fairy Tales,” mentions parallels in Irish, Scotch, English (“The Old Woman and her Pig”) German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Bengali, and refers to suggestions that its origin is probably to be traced back to some religious ceremonial in early times. A similar version of the tale is known in the North of the Island, but “winter branch” is substitued for “”bonny bunch of blackberries,” and the tale is named “Skeeal y Vangan Gheuree.” (The Tale of the Winter’s Branch). Mr Roeder gives a South-side variant in “Yn Lioar Manninagh” vol. III. Pt IV.}",
