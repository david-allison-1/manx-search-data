YN CHAGLYM MANNINAGH,,
,UNIQUE PROGRAMME,
,"     One of the most remarkable gatherings which has ever taken place in this country took place recently (March 27th, 1914) in Douglas.

,"After the repast, which was, of course, heartily enjoyed, the following programme was gone through under the conduct of",
Mainstyr yn Chaglym,The Master of Ceremonies,
," (Mr H. Percy Kelly). Every item was given in the Manx language, and Mr Kelly’s introduction in each case was most apt:-",

,,
,"     Mrs Corlett’s and Mrs Royston’s duets (arrane-jees) were most pleasing, as were also the songs and the chorus by the children (ny paitchen).",
,"     A pleasing feature was the enthusiastic speech made by Mr G. Fred Clucas, who was on a brief visit from Bristol. He presented, on behalf of the Society, to ten of the children in the Manx class, rewards for their industry and skill in learning the language.",
,"     A party of ten came from Peel with Miss Morrison, and they added considerably to the wealth of conversation in the vernacular. The Peel party included Mrs Corkill, Miss Callister, Miss Crean, Mr Joe Moore, Mr Cæsar Cashen, and Mr Christopher Shimmin, and a little grand-child of Mr Moore’s, aged eight years, who could speak and sing Manx beautifully.",
,"     The speeches of the chairman, and those of Mrs Corkill, Miss Morrison, and the Messrs Cowley, J.J. Kneen (the president of the society), W. Kissack, and J. Moore, were heartily received; while the cooish by Dr Marshall and Mr T. Dodd was most amusing. ",
,The following are some of the contributions given:-,
,THE CHAIRMAN’S SPEECH,

We managed our first meeting last year well, and you were present then will keep in mind that it was our desire that this event would become an annual event.",

Our hope is in the children for the times to come, and if we fail to sow the good seed in their minds, it won’t be very long until our language will be forgotten and meetings like this altogether ended.",

They have an opportunity tonight to hear the mother-tongue of the Isle of Man from the lips of those who were accustomed to make use of it from their youth as the only way to speak together.,
"Cha row rieau caa lheid shoh aym pene dy heet gys meeiteil raad va Gailck er ny loayrt, as nee yn sleih aeg gyn dooyt cooinaghtyn er fastyr myr shoh, as nee ny lessoonyn t’ad gynsagh nish tannaghtyn foddey ayns ny aignaghyn oc.","I never had such an opportunity myself, to come to a meeting where Manx was spoken, and the young people will no doubt remember an evening like this, and the lessons they learn now will remain long in their minds.

I must give thanks to you for inviting me again to take the chair. I consider it a great honour and I would rather that I were more suitable for it.",

,"I’m sure that you children have taken great pleasure in your Manx lessons, and you should be proud that you know something of the language of the native fathers. It has been the tongue of Edward Christian, and William Christian, and all the chief and learned Manx people, in days done past, and you are better for having knowledge of the language.",

","It may be yet like a beautiful jewel about their necks that cannot be taken from them. Every nation is proud of the language of their own country. We will pay no heed to the taunts we get against Manx. Those who throw them cannot speak the language themselves, and they don’t want other people to speak it. ",

The Manx language is the endowment that our ancestors have left to us that cannot be taken from us. Let’s, then, all the haste we can to get from the older people, before they go, the right sound to speak it. Once it is lost (it) is lost forever.",

But, with patience and ardour, I expect that we will gain the victory. ",

We will then leave the work to others to preserve and to teach the language to the generations to come.",
,INTERESTING STORY BY MR CÆSAR CASHEN.,
“JUAN AS YN DOOINNEY MARREY’,“JUAN AND THE MERMAN.”,
"     Mysh keead blein er-dy-henney va dooinney ayn as ’n ennym echey Juan. As hie eh dys yn traie dy yeeaghyn son partanyn, as myr v’eh ronsagh fud ny creggyn haink dooinney marrey seose ass yn ushtey rish lhiattee yn creg. ","     About a hundred years ago there was a man and his name was Juan. And he went to the shore to look for crabs, and as he was searching amongst the rocks a merman came up out of the water by the side of the rock. ",
"Dooyrt eh rish Juan, “Cur partan dou!”","He said to Juan, “Give me a crab!”",
"“Cha derym partan dhyt, edyr,” dooyrt Juan, “t’ou abyl tayrn palchey partanyn dhyt hene.”","“I won’t give you a crab, at all,” said Juan, “you’re able to haul plenty of crabs for yourself.”",
" “Cha vel,” dooyrt yn dooinney marrey, “cha nel mee abyl dy hayrn nane meehene.” As dooyrt yn dooinney marrey rish Juan, “My ver oo partan dou, cha bee oo dy bragh baiht ayns yn ’aarkey choud as vees oo er thalloo chirrym.”","“No,” said the merman, “I’m not able to haul one myself.” And the merman said to Juan, “If you give me a crab, you will never be drowned in the ocean as long as you are on dry land.”",
"     As laa-ny-vairagh hie Juan gys yn eeastagh ayns y baatey beg echey, as tra v’eh er-jeet dys yn aaley-eeastee[4], cheau eh yn aker magh as ren eh yn chord shickyr, as hoie eh sheese ayns y vaatey dy gheddyn y rimlagh aarloo as ny dug-gannee* bitit. ","     And the next day Juan went to the fishing in his little boat, and when he had come to the fishing mark, he threw the anchor out and made the cord secure, and he sat down in the boat to get the fishing line ready and the hooks baited. ","[4] aaley] ALEY, AILEY, s. when the fishermen have let down their lines, or shot their nets, they say er-aley mie, or sie, good or bad, according to their take ; fishing-ground, drift, lay. (Kelly, J.)"
* Ny dooanyn,,
"Haink yn dooinney marrey cheddin seose dy mullagh yn ushtey ec lhiattee yn baatey, as dooyrt eh:","The same merman came up to the top of the water at the side of the boat, and he said:",
"“Yuan, Yuan! T’ou er-choayl dty cheeayl ta mee shein.”","“John, John! You’ve lost your mind I think.”",
"     As dooyrt Juan, “C’red ta jannoo ort nish?”","     And Juan said, “What’s up with you now?”",
"As dooyrt yn dooinney marrey, “T’ou er cheau yn aker magh as t’eh er-jeet sheese trooid yn chimlee aym ayns yn rhum aarlee. Te ny share dhyt, Yuan, dy pluckey yn aker seose as urragh bit beg, as my nee oo jannoo shen yiow palchey yeeast.”","And the merman said, “You’ve thrown the anchor out and it has come down through my chimney in the kitchen. It’s best for you, Juan to pull the anchor up and wait a little bit, and if you do that you’ll get plenty of fish.”",
"     As ren Juan shen y yannoo, as hooar eh palchey yeeast. As va Juan as yn dooinney marrey ny reih chaarjyn rieau lurg shen. She[5] jerrey yn cooish.","     And Juan did that , and he got plenty of fish. And Juan and the merman were always best friends after that.",[5] She] Evidently a misprint for ‘Shoh’.
,This is the end of the matter.,

Many friends have gone to that land yonder from which no traveller comes back. There is one old friend who has left us who was with us last year, that wonderful old bard, Mr William Cain. Many’s the time when I was young I have listened to him singing Manx songs and playing his musical instrument. But he and others are gone, and the gaps they have left will never the filled again.",

Therefore, let our motto be, “Our people, our country, our language!”",[7] son jannoo] ‘for doing’ — perhaps there is something missing her; ‘ta shin son jannoo’] ‘that we can do’ would be expected here..
