OSSIAN'S POEMS: THE BATTLE OF LODA.,BARDAGHT OSHIN: CAH LODA.
"DUAN I. — The bards distinguished those compositions, in which the narration is often interrupted by episodes and apostrophes, by the name of Duan.",DOON I.
A tale of the times of old! ,Skeeal jeh earishyn shendiaght! 
"     Why, thou wanderer unseen! thou bender of the thistle of Lora; why, thou breeze of the valley, hast thou left mine ear? ","     Cammah, uss rouailtagh keillit! uss croymmeder jeh’n onnane Lora; cammah, uss geay-kiune ny glionney, vel oo er hreigeil my chleaysh? "
,
I hear no distant roar of streams ! No sound of the harp from the rock! ,Cha vel mee clashtyn tassane jeh strooanyn foddey! Cha nee kiaull y claasagh veih’n chreg! 
"Come, thou huntress of Lutha, Malvina. call back his soul to the bard. ","Tar, uss ben-helgee Lutha, Valvina, aa-eam e annym da’n Vardagh. "
"I look forward to Scandinavia of lakes, to the dark billowy bay of U-thorno, where Fingal descends from ocean, from the roar of winds. ","Ta mee jeeaghyn roym er Loghlin jeh loghyn, gys y vaie U-thorno mooireeragh dorraghey, raad ta Fingal çheet neose veih faarkey, veih buirrooghid ny geayee. "
Few are the heroes of Morven in a land unknown.,Stiark ny treanee Vorven ayns çheer gynyss.
"     Starno sent a dweller of Loda to bid Fingal to the feast; but the king remembered the past, and all his rage arose.","     Hug Starno cummaltagh Loda cuirrey Fingal gys y feailley ; agh chooinee y ree keayrt shaghey, as dirree ooilley e chorree."
"“Nor Gormal’s mossy towers , nor Starno, shall Fingul behold.","“Nar tooryn keynnee dy Ghormal, nar Starno, ver Fingal my-ner."
"Deaths wander, like shadows, over his fiery soul!","Ta baaseyn rouail, myr scadooghyn, harrish e annym çhennoil!"
"Do I forget that beam of light, the white-handed daughter of kings?*","“Vel mee jarrood scell hoilshee 'n shid, yn ’neen vane-lauey jeh reeghyn?"
"*Agandecca, the daughter of Starno, whom her lather killed, on account of her discovering to Fingal a plot laid against his life.",
"Go, son of Loda; his words are wind to Fingal: wind that, to and fro, drives the thistle in autumn’s dusky vale.” ","Immee royd, mac Loda; ta e ghoan geay rish Fingal: geay, ta, huggey’s veih, sheebey yn onnane ’sy choan keeir fouyragh.”"
"     “Duth-maruno, arm of death !","     “Duth-maruno, roih vaaish!"
Cromma-glas; of iron shields!,"Cromma-glas, jeh scaapyn yiarn!"
"Struthmor, dweller of battles’ wing!  ","Struthmor, cummaltagh jeh skian chaggee!"
"Cormar, whose ships bound on seas, careless as the course of a meteor, on dark, rolling clouds!","Cormar, lesh lhongyn echey clistal er faarkaghyn, neuchiarailagh myr coorse jeh drilleen--aeragh, er bodjallyn keeirey ta rowlal!"
"Arise around me, children of heroes, in a land unknown!","Irree mygeayrt-y-moom, cloan jeh treanee, ayns çheer gynyss!"
"Let each look on his shield, like Trenmor, the ruler of wars.”","Lhig da gagh fer jeeaghyn er e scaap, gollrish Trenmor, fer-reill dy chaggaghyn.”"
"      “Come down,” thus Trenmor said, “thou dweller between the harps! ","      “Tar neose,” myr-shoh dooyrt Trenmor, “uss cummaltagh eddyr ny claasaghyn!"
"Thou shalt roll this stream away, or waste with me in earth.”","Rowlys oo strooan y shoh ersooyl, er-nonney goys oo mow mârym ’syn ooir.”"
     Around the king they rise in wrath. No words come forth: they seize their spears. ,     Mygeayrt y ree ta’d girree ayns jymmoose. Cha nee focklyn çheet assdoo: ta’d greimmey nyn shleiyghyn.
Each soul is rolled into itself.,Ta gagh annym rowlit ayn hene.
At length the sudden clang is waked on all their echoing shields.,Fy-yerrey ta’n feiyr doaltattym dooishtit er ooilley ny scaapyn aasheeanagh oc.
Each takes his hill by night; at intervals they darkly stand. ,Ta gagh fer goaill e ghun er-roie; ec keayrtyn t’ad nyn shassoo dy-keeir. 
Unequal bursts the hum of songs between the roaring wind! ,Neuchorrym ta’n tessane d’arraneyn brishey magh eddyr y gheay garveigagh ! 
Broad over them rose the moon!,Lhean harroo dirree yn eayst!
"     In his arms came tall Duth-maruno; be, from Croma of rocks, stern hunter of the boar! ","     Ayns e eilley haink Duth-maruno toallee; eshyn, veih Croma ny creggey, shelgeyr trean jeh’n phurr! "
"In his dark boat he rose on waves, when Crumthormo* awaked its woods.","Ayns e vaatey dorraghey dirree eh er tonnyn, tra ghooisht Crumthormo e keylljyn."
* Crumtharmoth. one of the Orkney or Shetland Islands.,
"In the chase he shone among foes: No fear was thine, Duth-maruno!","Ayns y çhelgeyrys hoilshee eh mastey noidyn: Cha nee aggle lhiats, Duthmaruno !"
"      “Son of daring Comhal, shall my steps be forward through night?","     “Vac Chomhal-dunnal, vees my chesmadyn roym fud-ny-hoie? "
"From this shield shall I view them, over their gleaming tribes!","Voish scaap y shoh jeeaghym orroo, harrish nyn gleinnyn londyrnee?"
"Starno, king of lakes, is before me, and Swaran, the foe of strangers. ","Ta Starno, ree jeh loghyn, roym, as Swaran, yn noid jeh joarreeyn. "
"Their words are not in vain, by Loda’s stone of power.”","Cha vel nyn vocklyn fardalagh, liorish clagh Loda dy phooar.”"
"     “Should Duth-maruno not return, his spouse is lonely at home, where meet two roaring streams on Chrathmo-craulo’s plain.","     “Mannagh jyndaays Duth-maruno, ta’n venheshey echey ny-lomarcan ec y thie, raad ta daa strooan buirroogh çheet nyn-guail er strah Chrathmo-craulo."
"Around are hills, with echoing woods, the ocean is rolling near.","Mygeayrt ta croink, lesh keylljyn aasheeanagh, ta’n aarkey rowlal faggys."
"My son looks on screaming seafowl, a young wanderer on the field.","Ta my vac jeeaghyn er yeeanlee ny marrey screeagh, rouailtagh aeg er magher."
"Give the head of a boar to Can-dona, tell him of his father’s joy, when the bristly strength of U-thorno rolled on his lifted spear.","Cur kione phurr da Candona insh rish jeh’n voggey ec e ayr, tra rowl yn troshid fynnagh U-thorno er e shleiy troggit."
Tell him of my deeds in war! Tell where his father fell!”,Insh rish jeh my yannoo ayns caggey! Insh rish raad huitt e ayr!”
"     “Not forgetful of my fathers,” said Fingal. “I have bounded over the seas.","     “Cha nee jarrood aym er my ayraghyn,” dooyrt Fingal, “ta mee er clistal harrish y cheayn."
"Theirs were the times of danger, in the days of old. ","Lhieusyn ny keayrtyn dy ghanjeyr, ayns laghyn dy hendiaght. "
,
"Nor settles darkness on me, before foes, though youthful in my locks.","Nar soiagh dorrid sheese orrym. kiongoyrt noidyn, ga s’aeg mish ayns my keogyn."
"Chief of Crathmo-cranlo, the field of night is mine.’      ","Ard-er Chrathmo-cranlo, she magher d’oie lhiams.”"
"     Fingal rushed, in all His arms, wide-bounding over Turthor’s stream, that sent its sullen roar, by night, through Gormals misty vale.","     Roie Fingal dy-tappee, ayns ooilley’n eilley echey, lheimyraght dy-lhean harrish strooan Turthot, dy dug e buirroogh groamagh, er-oie, trooid glion chayagh Ghormal."
"A moonbeam glittered on a rock; in the midst stood a stately form; a form with flowing locks, like Lochlin’s white-bosomed maids.","Hoilshee’n rehollys dy-gial er creg; hass ’sy veanjee tuarystal stoamey ; tuarystal lesh skeogyn etlagh, gollrish ny caillinyn bane-oghrishagh Loghlin."
"Unequal are her steps, and short.","Neuchorrym ta ny kesmadyn eck, as giare."
She throws a broken song on wind.,T’ee ceau arrane brisht er y gheay.
At times she tosses her white arms: for grief is dwelling in her soul.,Ec keayrtyn t’ee ceau mygeayrt e roihaghyn baney: son ta seaghin baghey ayns e hannym.
"     “Torcul-torno, of aged locks!”she said, “where now are thy steps, by Lolan?","     “Torcul-torno, jeh skeogyn eashit!” dooyrt ee, “cre vel nish dty chesmadyn-coshey, rish Lulan?"
"Thou hast failed at thine own dark streams, father of Conban-cârgla! But I behold thee, chief of Lulan, sporting by Loda’s hall, when the dark-skirted night is rolled along the sky.—","T’ou er failleil ec ny strooanyn dooey lhiat-hene, ayr Chonban-cârgla ! Agh ta mee cur oo my-ner, ard-er dy Lulan, jannoo reaïd rish halley Loda, tra ta’n oie keeir-çhemmallagh rowlit fud y speyr."
Thou sometimes hidest the moon with thy shield.,Keayrtyn t’ou follaghey yn eayst lesh dty scaap.
I have seen her dim in heaven.,Ta mee er vakin ee dullyr ayns niau.
"Thou kindlest thy hair into meteors, and sailest along the night.","T’ou foaddey dt’ olt gys drilleenyn-aeragh, as shiaulley fud-ny-hoie."
"Why am I forgot, in my cave, king of shaggy boars?","Cre’n-fa ta mee jarroodit, ’syn ooig aym, ree jeh purryn geayshteenagh?"
Look from the hall of Loda on thy lonely daughter.” ,Jeeagh veih’n halley Loda er dt’ inneen ny-lomarcan.” 
,
"     “Who art thou,” said Fingal, “voice of night?” She, trembling, turned away. ","     “Quoi t’ou,” dooyrt Fingal, “coraa jeh'n oie?” "
,"Ish, er-creau, hyndaa ersooyl. "
"“Who are thou, in thy darkness?”","“Quoi t’ou, ayns dty ghorraghys?”"
     She shrunk into the cave. ,Hooar ee back ’syn ooig.
     The king loosed the thong from her hands. He asked her about her fathers. ,     Deayshil y ree yn yeeal ’er e laueyn. Denee eh jee mysh e ayraghyn.
"     “Torcul-torno,” she said, “once dwelt at Lulan’s foamy stream: he dwelt—but now, in Loda’s hall, he shakes the sounding shell.","     “Torcul-torno,” dooyrt ee, “keayrt vagh eh ec y strooan keshagh Lolan: vagh eh—agh nish, ayns halley Loda, t’eh coyrt y tlig sheeanagh er-creau."
He met Starno of Lochlin in war: long fought the dark-eyed kings.,Hie eh ny quail Starno dy Loghlin ayns caggey; chaggee ny reeaghyn doo-hooillagh rish foddey.
"My father fell, in his blood, blue-shielded Torcul-torno!","Huitt m’ayr, ayns e uill, Torcul-torno gorm-scaapagh!"
"By a rock, at Lulan’s stream, I had pierced the bounding roe.","Ec creg, ec strooan Lulan, va mee er vroddey y feeaih clistal."
My white hand gathered my hair from off the rushing winds.,Hymsee my laue vane m’olt ersooyl veih sheebane y geayee.
I heard a noise. Mine eyes were up. My soft breast rose on high.,Chluin mee tarmane. Va my hooillyn troggit. Dirree my chleeau stoamey.
"My step was forward, at Lulan, to meet thee, Torcul-tarno!","Va my chesmad er my hoshiaght, ec Lulan, dy heet dty whail, Torcul-torno!"
"It was Starno, dreadful king ! His red eyes rolled on me in love.","She Starno v’ayn, ree agglagh! rowl e hooillyn jiargey orrym er cannoo."
Dark waved his shaggy brow above his gathered smile.,Heeb y folt casagagh dhoan er e oaie erskyn e smooir çhymsit.
"Where is my father, I said, he that was mighty in war?","Cre vel m’ayr, dooyrt mee, eshyn va niartal ayns caggey?"
"Thou art left alone among foes, O daughter of Torcul-torno!","T’ou faagit dty lomarcan ny-vud noidyn, O inneen Horcul-torno!"
He took my hand. He raised the sail. In this cave he placed me dark.,"Ghow eh my lane, Hrog eh y shiaull. Hug eh mee ayns ooig y shoh."
"At times he comes, a gathered mist. He lifts before me my father’s shield.",Ec keayrtyn t’eh çheet gollrish kay. T’eh troggal scaap my hayrey kiongoyrt rhym.
"But often passes a beam of youth, far distant from my cave. ","Agh ta mennick goll shaghey scell d’aegid, foddey jeh veih m’ooig. "
The son of Starno moves in my sight. He dwells lonely in my soul.”,Ta’n mac Starno gleayshaghey ayns my hilley. T’eh baghey ny-lomarcan ayns m’annym.”
"     “Maid of Lulan,” said Fingal, “white-handed daughter of grief! a cloud, marked with streaks of fire, is rolled along thy soul.","     “Caillin dy Lulan,” dooyrt Fingal, “inneen fynn-laueagh dy hrimshey! ta bodjal, cowrit lesh scheimeigyn d’aile, rowlal ny-vud m’annym."
Look not to that dark-robed moon; look not to those meteors of heaven.,Ny jeeagh er eayst keeir-cloagagh y shenn; ny jeeagh er ny meiteyryn shen veih niau.
"My gleaming steel is around thee, the terror of thy foes!","Ta my staillin falleayshagh mygeayrt-y-mood, yn aggle jeg dty noidyn!"
"It is not the steel of the feeble, nor of the dark in soul!","Cha nee staillin jeh ny annooinee eh, ny jeu ta keeir ayns annym!"
The maids are not shut in our caves of streams.,Cha vel ny caillinyn doont ayns nyn ooigyn jeh strooanyn.
They toss not their white arms alone. They bend fair within their locks above the harps of Selma.,"Cha vel ad ceau nyn roihaghyn baney mygeayrt nyn-lomarcan, t’ad croymmey aalin ayns nyn skeoeyn erskyn ny claasee Selma."
Their voice is not in the desert wild. We melt along the pleasing sound!”,"Cha vel nyn goraa ayns yn eaynagh, Ta shin lheie lesh y vingys eunyssagh!”"
"     Fingal again advanced his steps, wide through the bosom of night, to where the trees of Loda shook amid squally winds.","     Hie Fingal er-e-hoshiaght reesht, feayn fud oghrish ny hoie, gys raad va biljyn dy Loda er-creau mastey geayaghyn screeagh."
"Three stones, with heads of moss, are there; a stream, with foaming course: and dreadful, rolled round them, is the dark-red cloud of Loda. ","Ta three claghyn, lesh king keynnee, aynshen, - strooan lesh coorse keshagh: as agglagh, rowlit mygeayrt-y-moo, ta’n bodjal jiarg dullyragh dy Loda. "
"High from its top looked forward a ghost, half-formed of the shadowy smoke. ","Heose er e vullagh va jeeaghyn magh ny scaan, lieh-cummit lesh jaagh kayagh. "
"He poured his voice, at times, amidst the roaring stream.","Gheayrt eh e choraa, ec keayrtyn, sy mean jeh ny strooanyn buirroogh."
"Near, bending beneath a blasted tree, two heroes received his words:","Faggys, croymmey fo billey shirkit, hooar daa ghunnalagh e ocklyn:"
