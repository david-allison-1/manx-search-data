"Gyn-oayll, gyn-oayll er thalloo lhome, ","Lost, lost on desolate land,",
"Myr keyrrey cailt va mee, ","Like a lost sheep I was,",
Er-shaghryn ass yn cassan cair ,"Having strayed from the proper path,",
Tra orrym huitt yn oie.,When upon me the night fell.,
"Ro-anmagh arrys va mee goaill, ","Too late I repented,",
"Va giat y clieau[2] nish jeight, ","The mountain gate now shut,","[2] giat y clieau] ‘the mountain gate’ also, ‘the Mountain Road (Ramsey to Douglas)."
"My lomarcan ayns dorraghys, ","Alone in darkness,",
Er chassan lioryms reiht.,On a path chosen by me.,
"Eisht: ren mee clashtyn bochilley, ","Then: I heard a shepherd,",
"Ass dorrid v’eh dty ghra, ","From a darkness he was saying,",
"“Chyndaa, chyndaa, ayns shoh ta’n raad ","“Turn, turn, here is the way",
As oayll son ayds dy bra.”,And you know where you are evermore.,
