"Va keayrt dy row ayns ny shenn laghyn dy dug yn shag as y chraitnag nyn goyrle cooidjagh dy yannoo red ennagh son ny boghtyn son va chimmey oc er, as hie ad magh ayns ny ghluintyn dy heih ollan son dy yannoo eaddagh er nyn son.","There was a time in the olden days when the cormorant and the bat took counsel together to do something for the poor (people)  because had compassion on them, and they went into the glens gathering wool to make clothing for them."
"Tra va sluight mie er ny heih oc hooar ad lhong, as haghyr eh dy ve myr v’ad shiaulley, dy daink sterrym er as va ny tonnyn brishey harrish y lhong ayns wheesh dy row yn chraitnag boght lhiemmeragh mygeayrt veih boayl dy boayl voish yn ushtey, as ayns y dorraghys v’eh tilgit magh ass y lhong cummal er maijey raue. ","When they had a quantity gathered they procured a boat. Is happened as they were sailing, that a storm came on and the waves were breaking over the vessel, insomuch  that the poor bat had to leap from place to escape the water, and in the darkness he was cast out of the boat clinging to an oar."
"Ec brishey yn laa v’eh ergerrey da’n traie, as dettyl eh stiagh dys thalloo chirrym.","At daybreak he was near the shore, and he flew in unto dry land."
"     Va follian ny hassoo ayns shen, as dooyrt eshyn rish “Och! chraitnag beg boght, c’red ta jannoo ort dy vel oo ooiliey er-creau goll-rish shoh?” ","A seagull standing near by, enquired “O, poor little bat, what is troubling you that you shiver so?”"
"Tra cheayll eh ooilley yn skeeal echey, “Cha shickyr as lhiass,” dooyrt eh, “dy darragh eh ort ghoghe eh dty vioys void.”","When he heard the bat’s story, “It is certain,” he said, “if he will happen on thee he will take away your life.”"
     Son va gialdyn oddyr oc nagh jinnagh yn derrey yeh faagail yn jeh elley jeu dys va’n obbyr oc ec kione. ,     They had given each other a promise that the one would not leave the other until they had completed their task.
Va’n chraitnag agglit wheesh dy cheill eh hene ayns shenn tholthan dy row dys va’n cheeiragh er; as voish shen dys nish cha jinnagh eh cheet magh roish yn oie.,The bat was so frightened that he hid himself in an old ruin that was until the darkness came on; and from that time until now he will only come out under the covering of the night.
"     Chumm yn shag er y lhong derrey v’ee lheenit lesh ushtey as hie ish dys toyn ny marrey; fy-yerrey hie eh dys creg, as hoie eh ayns shen ooraghyn recheilley laa lurg laa. ","     The cormorant held on to the boat until she filled with water and sank to the bottom of the sea; at last he flew to a rock, and there sat for hours together, day after day, looking out for the bat."
"Keayrtyn elley t’eh goll son tammylt dys ny ghluinteeyn; as woish y sterrym shen myr shoh ta’d foast, unnane cheill eh hene as y fer elley shirrey er e hon.","At other times he will go for a season into the glens; and in this way they continue from that storm to the present time — the one hides himself, and the other seeks him."
