"Gob-ny-Scotte[11], Sal-Maghal, gurie,[12] 1844.","Gob-ny-Scoute, Maughold Parish, Winter, 1844.","[11] [Gob-ny-scooyt] ‘The Promontory of the Gushing (Water)’, a parcel of land situated in Maughold Parish, on the slopes of North Barrule, alternative spellings are [Gob-ny-Scoute];  [Gob-ny-Scout]; [Gob-ny-Shoot], in the possession of the Looney family of Boshin during the mid-nineteenth century. [Boshin], aka [Boashin]; or [Boshen], lies on the North East side of Barrule and is now known as ‘Hibernia’, after the Hibernian Hotel established at least as early as 1811 and extended to include lodging by Rachael Looney in 1841. The Hibernian Hotel, later The Hibernian Inn, was well known and popular with travellers between Ramsey and Douglas at this time and was also the appointed office for the paying of taxes, rents and tithes in the parish of Maughold in the mid-nenteenth century. Gob-ny-scooyt, adjoining the Hibernian Hotel, belonged to John (Jack) Looney who emigrated to Australia, and his wife Rachael who followed him to Australia in May 1842 (but died on the way). The hotel, and likely Gob-ny-Scooyt too, was subsequently owned, or rented by a Mr. McMinn from Feb 1843, then a Mr. Robert McNeil until 1846, then a Mr Brew until 1850, a Mr Callister around 1870, a Mr Kneen sometime after that. The final tenant seems to have been a Mrs Caley who ceased trading in 1908. ‘Bogane Gob-ne-Scout’ seems to have been was a well known song, written by a Kerruish, although it seems no copy of the words is extant. That the area was still known as Boshin is evidenced in an obituary notice for Ewan Looney of Boshen in Mona’s Herald 30.10.1850. (There is also a farm called Boshen near Crosby in the Parish of Marown, near Eaiy Vane and Ballalough.)
