  "notes": "\u0027Manx Dishes\u0027 is a chapter (pages 172 to 203) in \u0027The Manx Cookery Book\u0027. The full front title of the book is \u0027THE MANX COOKERY BOOK \u2014 ISSUED IN AID OF THE PEEL CHURCH SPIRE REBUILDING FUND\u0027. On the inside cover page it is titled \u0027THE MANX COOKERY BOOK Of FAVOURITE DISHES\u0027. It was published by Sherratt \u0026 Hughes of London \u0026 Manchester in 1908. Most of the recipes are given in Manx, with English beneath. The preface finishes with \u0027Sophia Morrison and Louisa Morrison, Lady Raglan\u0027s Stall, Church Spire Rebuilding Fund Bazaar, Christian\u0027s Schools, Peel. August 26th and 27th, 1908.\u0027 The book was available for sale at the bazaar, so was evidently published before that date. \n\nContributors to the \u0027Manx Dishes chapter include many who were also involved with the Manx Society (Y\u00C7G). The contributions appear not to have been edited or standardised. \n\nThe use of the imperative and choice of formal (plural) / informal (singular) forms varies considerably. \n\nWhere details that appear in the Manx versions of the recipe are omitted or differ to the English translation a translation (by R. Teare) has been inserted in square brackets. The Manx has not been altered, except in a few instances where an evident typo of [c] for [l] has been corrected, eg; [lhiabbee] for [chiabbee]. \n\nMr. Thomas Crellin, Oakland, California is credited in the preface with having paid the costs of publication. The two day bazaar itself included performances of Cushag\u0027s plays; \u0027Rosie Basins\u0027 and \u0027The Lazy Wife, also offered collections of Manx prints and paintings and had stalls representing Ireland, Scotland, the Isle of Man, England, Wales, Japan and Norway. It was reported to have raised \u00A3600 towards the fund.",
