"One evening last month, there gathered in Douglas a score of students and aged speakers of the Manx Gaelic, by invitation of Dr. Marshall, who has been for some years an enthusiastic student of the language. The proceedings took place in the Palace Restaurant, and Mr Cecil Callister was responsible for the following menu:— ",,,

"    Just prior to the commencement of the repast, a car arrived with a Purt ny Hinshey (Peel) contingent, consisting of Miss S Morrison, Mrs Corkill, and Messrs, Cæsar Cashen, and Jos. Moore, or Patrick. The Chairman, at the subsequent procedings, was Mr. H. Percy Kelly, B.A., and all the items on the programme were in the Manx Gaelic. Songs and recitations were given by the Messrs Cain (blind), Gelling (Braddan), J. J. Kneen (Port Erin), — Cowley, Joseph Moore, C. Cashen, the Chairman, and A. H. Tyson (“Ta Traa goll Thie”).

Address in Manx by Mr H. Percy Kelly. ,,,
The Chairman gave the following address:—,,,
[Translation of  the Manx original.],,,
"Ladies and gentlemen,—I am sure it gives me great pleasure to see around me tonight so many of my countrymen and women who have a true love for our mother tongue, and I am proud that you have bestowed on me the high honour of asking me to preside over an assembly which may be described as quite unique, in these modern days. ","Mraane ooasle as gheiney seyrey, te cur lane taitnys dooys ta mee shickyr dy akin mygeayrt y moom noght whilleen dy sleih jeh’n cheer ain, ta graih firrinagh oc son nyn jengey ny mayrey, as ta mee feer voyrnagh dy vel shiu er hoiaghey wheesh jeem as dy vriaght jeem dy reill harrish yn veeiteil shoh, meeiteil foddyms gra lheid as nagh vel feer cadjin ayns ny traaghyn t’ayn. ",,
"I observe that the invitation in the newspaper was limited to speakers of of Manx Gaelick, and I suppose you are all competent in that respect. (Laughter.) As for myself, this is the first attempt I have ever made to address a Manx audience in my native tongue, and I hope, on that account, that you will be lenient to my faults.","Ren mee goaill tastey dyrois yn chuirrey ayns y pabyr er ny chur ynrican da sleih ta loayrt gailck as ta mee goaill eh dy vod shiu ooilley toiggal as loayrt eh dy mie (garaghtee).

",,
"The number of people who can keep up a conversation in Manx Gaelick to-day is indeed small, insomuch that it is becoming every day more difficult for learners to get their tongues oiled sufficiently, so to speak, to give the proper accent to the words. (Applause). ","Ta’n earroo dy sleih feer goaun nish ta jargal cummal seose co-loayrt gailckagh ayns wheesh as dy vel eh gaase gagh laa ny s’doillee da ynseydee dy gheddyn yn chengey oc ooillit dy liooar, myr dy beagh, dy chur yn vree cair er ny focklyn.","Ta’n earroo dy sleih feer goaun nish ta jargal cummal seose co-loayrt gailckagh ayns wheesh as dy vel eh gaase gaagh laa ny s’doillee da ynseydee dy gheddyn yn chengey oc ooillit dy liooar, myr dy beagh, dy chur yn vree cair er ny focklyn.",
"     I am glad to observe that our friend, Mr J. J. Kneen, is with us to-night. (Applause). I suppose there is not a living Manxman who has done more than he has to promote the revival of the old language, and it was at one of his classes here in Douglas that the idea of calling together this happy party was first mooted. ","     Ta mee feer wooiagh dy akin yn carrey ain Juan y Creen marin.

"     I must not forget to mention the worthy secretary of our Manx Language Society, Miss Morrison. (Applause). She has done any amount of good work in various ways, and especially by filling the coffers of the Society by means of the Manx plays during the past winter (Applanse). We have been in low water long enough, but now, now, I trust, that we have seen the last of our troubles, so far as money is concerned. ","     Shegin daue gyn jarrood yn scrudeyr ooasle jeh’n cheshaght ghlare gailckagh Bnr Mylevoirrey, (Bassey), T’ee er n’yannoo mooarane dy vie ayns ymmodee aghtyn, as er-lheh liorish jannoo magh ny tashtaghyn jeh’n Cheshaght trooid ny cloieyn Vanninagh ayns y gheurey shoh s’jerree.

"      I rececived a message last night from our President and his good lady. They would have been delighted to join us to-night, but Mr Moore’s health would not permit him to come. They asked me, however, to convey to this meeting their best wishes for our success and happiness, (Applause).",    Hooar mee chaghteraght riyr voish yn ard-reiltagh jeh’n cheshaght Vanninagh as yn ven-seyr echey. Veagh ad er ve feer wooiagh dy ve marin noght agh cha nel Mr Moore mie dy liooar dy heet. Hug ad sarey dou ny yeih dy chur lesh hug yn meeiteil shoh ny yeearreeyn share oc son yn speeideilys vie jeh’n giense ain. (Bassey.),,
"     I must also mention the deep debt of gratitnde which we owe to the “gennel” Doctor for the splendid repast which we have just enjoyed, and I am sure you will all join with me in passing to him a hearty vote of thanks for his kindness. (Applause.) ","    Lhisin ghra roish my vees eh jarroodit aym dy vel yn booise share ain lhiastynit da’n fer-lhee gennal son yn lhongey aalin ta shin er n’ghoaill soylley jeh, as ta mee shickyr dy vel shin ooilley lane kianlt booise da son yn kenjallys vooar echey. (Bassey).",,
"    One word more, before ] bring this short “cooish” to a close, and that is to say that I hope with all my heart that this will only be the first of many similar meetings, and that our dear language may abide and flourish in the hearts of the sons and daughters of Ellan Vannin throughout the world for  all time. (Loud applause).","      Un ockle smoo roish tayrnym yn chooish shoh giare gys jerrey, as ta shen dy ghra dy vel mee treishteil voish bun my chree dy bee shoh yn chied ynrican jeh ymmodee meeiteilyn elley jeh’n cheint cheddin as dy jean yn ghlare deyr ain tannaghtyn as bishaghey ayns ny creeaghyn jeh ny mec as inneenyn Ellan Vannin trooid magh yn seihll son dy bragh (Ard vassey).",,
