Upon occasion of John Teare of Karlaan being under that dreadful sentence for a second relapse into the sin of fornication – under which he continued for above two years.,,
1762,,
Jurby August 15th 10th Sunday after Trinity: Manks 1 Cor. 5. 12–13,,
He being admitted to penance.,,

"1 Cor. 5. 12, 13.","1 Cor. 5. 12, 13.",
Do ye not judge them that are within? But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among your selves that wicked person.,Nagh vel shiuish brieunys ad shen ta stieh? Agh ad shen ta mnoih ta Djee. Shen y fa cur shiu er sool veih na meskey eu hein yn persoon meechrauee shen.,
"The holy apostle in this chapter doth sharply rebuke the church of Corinth for their great negligence in punishing scandalous offenders, directing to excommunication as the proper remedy for redressing such offences, and declaring the end & intention of that ecclesiastical censure to be the destruction of sin, & the salvation of the sinner. [118]","Ta’n ostyl casherick sy chabdil shoh, cur oghsyn gear da aglish Corinth son yn liggal shaghey mooar oc dy chaerragh peccee scammyltagh, pointeil dy charba ad veih’n aglish myr yn cour shaar dy chummal foeh leyd yn drogh yiannoo, as soilshagh dy vel yn vrieunyss shen ta’n aglish cur pointyt as kiaryt dy chur naardey peccah, as son sauaaltyss peccee.",
"Ye are puffed up, & have not rather mourned. v. 2.","Ta shiu er nyn sheagey seoyse lesh moayrn, as cha /vel/ [118] vel shiu na sloih er yobberan. v. 2.",
"He here censures the Church for tolerating scandalous offences in particular members; & not mourning, as in the primitive times Christians put on solemnly mourning attire & bewailed excommunicate persons, as those or rather much more than those that were dead.","Teh ayns shoh gheddyn foihl da’n Aglish son surran{se} da peccahchyn scammyltagh ayns payrt jeh na oltyn ec; as gyn dobberan, myr ayns toshiaght Creeiste{e}aght ren na Creeisteenyn dy crauee cur orroo coamreychyn ren soilshagh dy rou ad dobberan as ren ad keaney son persoonyn va er nan giarey magh ass yn Aglish myr son oc shen ny foddey smoo ny son oc shen va marroo.",
"St Austin saith, Thou lamentest for one dead, lament rather for him that liveth. Are the bowels of Christian mercy in thee, to lament for a body out of which the soul is departed, & not to lament for a soul from which God is departed?","Ta’n Noo Austin gra, t’ou dobberan son fer ta marroo, jiean dobberan na sloih son eh shen ta bio.

"I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit, have /judged/ [119] judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, & my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. v. 3, 4, 5.","Ta mish dy jiarroo myr gyn meriu sy challyn, agh meriu ayns spirryd, er vrieunyss [119] hanneh, myr dy beeyn meriu, ma-chion ec eh shen ta myr shen er yiannoo yn ryd shoh.

"As if he had said, altho’ I am absent from you in body, yet in mind & consent I am present with you; & also by my discerning spirit, & by the authority & power given me by our Lord Jesus Christ, I have already determined, that when you are solemnly gathered together /in/ [120] in the name of Christ & have my spirit concurring with you, & the power of Christ confirming the sentence pronounced by you, that you deliver this wicked person unto Satan, by casting him out of the Church, & leaving him to Gods executioner to inflict destructive punishment on his body, to bring him to repentance for the saving of his soul.","Myr dy beeagh eh er ghra, gah dy vel mee ass y raad vieu sy chorp, na yeih ayns cree as aigney ta mee mariu, as myrgheddyn liorish ma spirryd ta cur tastey, as liorish yn kied as yn phooar ta er na chur dhou liorish nan Tchiarn Dyeesey Creeist, ta mee kiaryt hanneh, tra ta shiu dy crauee er cheet quoishagh ayns ennym Chrieest, as yn spirryd ayms eu mariu, as pooar Chrieest [120] niartagh yn vrieunyss veeys er na chur lioriu, dy jiean shiu livrea yn persoo{n} mee chrauee shoh gyss Noid na anmey, liorish giarey eh magh ass yn Aglis{h} as faigail eh ta cur caerrag{h}ey foeh Djee dy chur caerraghey dowill er yn corp ec eh, dy chur lesh eh gyss arryss son sauaaltyss eh annym.",
"Where we may note, that this dreadful sentence & censure, consisteth in a separation from the communion of saints – & in delivering unto Satan, who had then a power over the excommunicated persons body to torment it with diseases.","Liorish oddyss shin cur tastey, dy vel yn vrieunyss as caerraghey aglagh shoh loih ayns scarrey veih sheshaght na noochin, as ayns livrea gys Noid na anmey, va pooar ec eh er korp yn persoon va giaryt magh ass yn Aglish dy horshagh e lesh doghanyn.",
"Which power tho’ now ceased, yet the Christian Church /has/ [121] has a power at this day to exclude enormous offenders & all sinners that persist in any notorious crime, from the ordinary means of grace & salvation, & to expose them to the malice & temptations of their grand adversary the Devil, by depriving them of Church communion, which is a far more dreadful punishment than many seem now to be truly sensible of.","Gah dy vel yn pooar shen er scuirr nish, na yeih ta pooar ec yn Aglish Chrieestee nish dy ghiarey magh drogh [121] yieantee mooar as dy chooilley pheccagh ta tannaghtyn dy cur rish peccah egee erbee, veih na saaysyn deh ghrayse as sauaaltyss, as dy livrea ad seoyse gyss goanlyss as miolaghyn nan ard noid yn Jouyl, liorish tcharba ad veih sheshaght na Aglish, ta na chaerraghey foddey s’aglee as s’atchimee na ta laan jieaghyn nish dy ve dy firrinagh tushtagh jeh.",

"By which we may observe, the solemn & awful manner in which the censure of excommunication was & is still for the most part pronounced in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ – having first in /solemn/ [122] solemn manner called upon our Lord Jesus Christ for his direction & benediction, or according to the command of Christ, by the authority & power of Christ, with an eye to his glory.","Liorish oddyss shin faikin yn aght crauee as arrymagh ayn va’n vrieunyss jeh giarey magh ass yn Aglish as ta kinjagh son yn ayrn smoo er na chur – ayns ennym nan Tchiarn Dyeesey – lurg da nan Tchiarn Dyeesey Creeist ayns aght crauee ve er na /eam/ [122] eam er son yn leideil as yn bannaght ec eh, ny cordail rish sareh Chrieest, lesh kied as pooar Chrieest, dy chur yn ghloyr ec eh er e hoshiaght.",
"And then Christ himself will be along with his chief pastor, as appears Mat: 16. 19. Joh: 20. 23. & his cooperation will make good the censure, as his commission was the warrant to pronounce it: and then the miserable penitent may & ought to dread the sentence, as coming out of Christs own mouth & to be inflicted by Christ himself.","As eisht bee Crieest hein marish eh ard vochill anmey myr ta ry aikin, Mat: 16. 19.

"And alass! the miserable case & state which that person who is duly excommunicat/ed/ed [123] is in – delivered up to Satan, as Gods executioner to inflict severe punishments on the persons body now cast out of Gods special protection, deprived of the Church’s communion, & exposed to the temptations & snares of our grand adversary, Satan.","As aless! yn aght as yn stayd treih ta’n persoon shen ayn, ta dy cooie er na ghiarey magh ass yn Aglish – er na livrea gyss Noid na anmey, myr foeh [123] Djee dy chur caerraghey dowill er, nish tilgyt magh veih ve foeh ard choadey Dyee, er na ghiarey veih sheshaght na Aglish, as er na hoiagh foshlyt gyss miolaghyn as ribbeychyn nan ard noid, yn Jouyl.",
"St Austin in his time declared, that it was then thought much more grievous to be excommunicated than to be beheaded.","Ren yn Noo Austin soilshagh sy traa ec eh shen, dy rou e smooinyt dy ve ryd foddey sdowill as trimshagh dy ve er na giarey magh ass yn Aglish ny yn kioan dy ve er na ghiarey jeh fer.",

"Now I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called /a brother/ [124] a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such an one, no, not to eat. v. 21.","Nish ta mee er scrieu hiu, gyn dy reall sheshaght my ta dooinney erbee ta er na enmyss braar, na fer /ta/ [124] ta cur rish maarderyss saintolagh, ny cur ooashley da jalloonyn, ny galtoon, ny na [sic] fer meshtal, ny goay{ll} cosney nieu-khiaral, marish leyd shen, gyn dy ghoayll beeih. v. 21.",
"Here the apostle admonishes & warns not to company with fornicators & others even drunkards, however we may think of it. Which is to shun all familiarity with wicked persons, who are a blot & blemish to our whole society, knowing that as a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump, so such a member continued among us, & not corrected & shuned, will defile the whole body of Christians.","Ayns shoh ta’n ostyl cur rauh as sarey gyn dy reall sheshaght rish maardyree ny fellagh elley dy jiarroo rish fellagh meshtal, cre erbee oddyss shinyn smooinaght jeh – ta wheeish as dy lishagh tchea veih sheshaght erbee y ve ain rish persoonyn mee chrauee, ta nan scammylt da’n slaan sheshaght ain, toiggal myr ta ryd beg deh sooryt sooragh yn slaan ta marish, myr shen nee leyd yn olt er na hannaghtyn na meskey ain, as gyn er na smaghtagh as er na chea veih, mylley yn slaan corp deh Chrieesteenyn.",
"Therefore purge out this old leaven. v. 6. cast out a scandalous person out of your communion, that your /whole/ [125] whole Church may be an holy society, forasmuch as you are by your profession of Christianity obliged to be separated from sin & sinners.","Shen y fa glen shiu ass yn shian sooryt shoh. v. 6. giar [125] shiu persoon scammyltagh ass yn tchessaght eu, dy vod yn aglish slaan eu y ve sheshaght casherick, son wheeish dy vel shiu liorish yn credjue Creeistee ta shiu goayll rish kianylt dy ve er nan scarrey veih peccah as peccee.",
"Therefore we are to avoid all brotherly intimacy and familiarity with scandalous Christians, lest the Church be thought to favour such: with such an one, saith he, no, not to eat; admit not such to your own table, much less to Christs.","Shen y fa ta shin dy chea veih sheshaght ny dellal y ve ain rish Creeisteenyn ta scammyltagh as olck, son nagh bee’n Aglish ain smooinyt dy gheayd rouh: marish leyd shen, t’eh gra, gyn dy eiee; ny sur shiu leyd ec yn boayrd eu hein, foddey sloo ec boayrd Chrieest.",
Thus may we see that as it ought to be the Church’s care to purge out such & separate them from her communion. So it is every private Christians duty to avoid familiarity or keeping company with them. /Therefore/ [126],Myr shoh foddee shin faikin myr lishagh e y ve kiarail yn Aglish dy chur magh nan leyd as dy scarrey ad veih sheshaght ree.

1. Let us consider &c.,1. Lig dooin &c.,
"Truly it is in general, a separation from the company & congregation of the faithful; /&/ [127] & so from the communion of the body & blood of Christ, as being the most sacred & solemn communion which Christians hold; in which they not only profess an union of their whole body with Christ their head, but also a mutual love & agreement one with another, in a most solemn manner.","Te dy firrinagh son yn chooid smoo, tcharba veih sheshsaght [sic] yn sloih kairal as mieh, as myr shen veih ]goayll[ Creesteeagh corp as [127] foill Chrieest, myr ta shen yn sheshaght smoo casherick as crauee ta Creeisteenyn freall; liorish cha vel ad na lomercan soilshagh dy vel yn slaan corp oc ayns unaanyss rish Creeist yn kioan oc, agh myrgheddyn dy vel ad ayns graih as cordail ry chelley, ayns yn aght smoo crauee.",
"Wherefore, if the prophane among the Heathens, & the unclean among the Jews, are by the dictates of nature as well as the law, separated from their sacred rites; therefore nature the rather forbids that notorious wicked persons should be partakers of what is sacred among /Christians/ [128] Christians, as the Christian religions excells all others in piety & purity.","Shen y fa, my ta ad shen ta olck meskey na anchreeisteenyn, as ad ta nieu ghlen meskey ny Hewnyn, liorish soilshey dooghyss cha mieh as yn leih, er nan scarrey veih na t’ad coontey casherick, shen y fa ta dooghyss na smoo liettal dy bee peccee egee as feer meechrauee goayll ayrn jeh na ta casherick meskey Creeisteenyn, myr ta’n credjue Creeistee er skyn dy chooilley chredjue elley ayns craueeaght, /cashe/ [128] casherickys as glennyt.",
"Therefore, as he who shall make it appear that such are to be separated from the Christian communion, & from civil society, will much more strongly prove that they should be separated from the communion of saints & from partaking of what is sacred.","Shen y fa nee eh shen nee soilshagh dy vel leyd shen dy ve er nan scarrey veih sheshaght as dellal erbee y ve oc rish Creeisteenyn, prowal foddee smoo dy vel ad dy ve er nan scarrey veih sheshaght na noochyn as veih goayll solley ny ayrn jeh na ta casherick.",
"So if any one shall say that the Christian Church hath not a power to excommunicate, he by that same denys the Church to be a society instituted by Christ.","Myr shen my nee fer erbee gran agh vel pooar ec yn Aglish Chreeistee dy ghiarey magh ass jee, t’eh liorish shen gobbal yn Aglish dy ve sheshaght oardyryt liorish Creeist.",
"Because a law or system of orders is the first & chief /institution/ [129] institution of all societies, whether civil or sacred, whereby all members are admitted into fellowship with, & separated from that society.","Kyndagh dy nee leih ny oardyryn pointyt yn ched as yn ard ryd ta cur toshiaght da sheshaghtyn orroo hein, eddyr thoa ny aglish, lioroo ta dagh olt [129] er nan goayll stiagh ayns sheshaght, as er nan giarey magh.",
"And whosoever are admitted to partake of the priviledges of any society, we know that they are always admitted upon this condition, that they will demean themselves to the precepts rules & orders prescribed & laid down for the society; but if they shall do otherwise, they are to be deprived of the priviledges & separated from the society.","As quoi erbee ta er nan goayll stiagh dy ghoayll ayrn jeh vondeysyn rish sheshaght erbee, ta fyss ain dy vel ad kinjagh er nan goayll stiagh er yn conaant shoh, dy jiean ad gymmyrkey ad hein cordail rish na sareychyn, slattyssyn as anneychyn ta pointyt as saryt cowir yn tcheshaght agh my nee ad jiannoo er aght elley, t’ad dy ve giaryt jeh na vondeysyn as er nan scarrey veih’n tcheshaght.",
"But there is this difference between the civil & spiritual or ecclesiastical society; that the civil, /having/ [130] having authority in temporals, not only deprives those that are disobedient of their priviledges, but as often as occasion requires, expells or cuts them off from the society by open force.","Agh ta’n caghla shoh eddyr yn tcheshaght thoa as aglish; dy vel yn thoa, myr ta pooar oc ayns gneechyn seihltagh, cha vel ad na lomercan giarey ad shen ta meeviallagh jeh na [130] jeh na foayryn as vondeysyn oc, agh cha mennick as ta feam ny oyr, t’ad scarrey ny giarey ad jeh veih’n tcheshaght lesh niart foshlyt.",
"But the ecclesiastical or spiritual, having no authority over the bodies of men, hath no other power of separating the wicked, but by withdrawing (as far as the state of humane affairs will admit) from the company of notorious wicked persons.","Agh yn Aglish myr nagh vel pooar ec harrish kirp deney, cha vel aght erbee ec dy scarrey na mee chrauee agh liorish freall (choud as oddyss dy mieh y ve) veih sheshaght persoonyn olck as mee-chrauee.",
"To this purpose are those precepts in holy Scripture[:] We command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw your/selves/ [131] selves from every brother that walketh disorderly. 2 Thes: 3. 6, 14. have no company with him that he may be ashamed. Now I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such as one, no, not to eat. 1 Cor. 5. 11.","Son shoh ta na sareychyn shen ayns Gooh casherick Dyee – Ta shin sareh shiu, vraarchyn, ayns ennym nan Tchiarn Dyeesey Creeist dy jiean shiu scarrey shiu hein veih dagh braar ta gimmeeaght dy neu-aightail. 2 Thes: 3.6,14.

"And that such separations are not merely (if it maybe so said) at discretion, or to be left to the discretion of every private Christian, but also judicial or according to judgment, to wit, to be decreed by the solemn judgment of the Church, which have full power in that case, is /sufficiently/ [132] sufficiently evident from what was said before concerning the right & authority of every society whether sacred or civil, not only in admitting members into fellowship, but also in expelling them.","As nagh vel leyd yn scarrey shen dy ve lurg aigney, ny dy ve faigyt gyss aght as aigney dagh Creeistee myr sallish, agh te myrgheddyn cordail rish brieunyss, ta shen, dy ve oardyryt liorish brieunyss crauee ny Aglish grunhtyt er as ayns Gooh Dyee, myr ren shin clashtyn nish, ta pooar slaan ec sy chooish, [132] shen, ta dy foshlyt er na hoilshagh liorish na va er na ghra roih ma-chion yn khairyss as pooar t’ec dagh sheshaght eddyr thoa ny aglish, cha nee na lomercan dy ghoayll stiagh oltyn ayns sheshaght, agh myrgheddyn dy ghiarey ad magh.",
"And he shall find it most difficult, whosoever will endeavour to give any other meaning or construction to those words of our blessed Saviour concerning the power of binding & loosing given to the Apostles Mat: 18. 18.","As nee eh gheddyn e er skyn ooilley doillee, nee shirrey dy chur bun erbee elley da goayn nan Sauaaltagh bannyt ma-chion yn pooar dy khianley as dy eosley er na chur da ny ostyllyn. Mat: 18.18.",
"Moreover, that the Christian Church is a society having or endued with such a power, the apostle sufficiently declares in this case of the incestuous person; distin/guishing/ [133] ‑guishing between those that are within, & those that are without. Do ye not judge them that are within? But them that are without, God judgeth. 1 Cor. 5. 12, 13.","Na sodjeh ny shoh, dy vel yn Aglish Chrieestee er na choamrey lesh leyd yn phooar, ta’n ostyl soilshagh dy foshlyt ayns cooish yn dooinney va kyndagh jeh croiagh; ayns cur caghla eddyr ad va stieh as ad ta mnoih. Nagh vel shiuish [133] brieunyss ad shen ta stieh? Agh ad shen ta mnoih, ta Djee brieunyss. 1 Cor. 5. 12, 13.",
"That is, they who are members of the Church, are subject to the judgment of the Church: They who are not members are to be left to the judgment of God.","Ta shen, ad shen ta oltyn jeh’n aglish, t’ad dy ve biallagh dy brieunyss na Aglish: Ta ad shen nagh vel oltyn dy ve faigyt gyss brieunyss Dyee.",
"And in the Epistle to Titus A man that is an heretick, after the first & second admonition, reject or avoid Tit: 3. 10.","As ayns yn scrieuyn gyss Titus – Dooinney ta ayns shaghrynyss veih’n chredjue, lurg yn ched as yn nah rauh, jean shiu giarey magh, ny tchea shiu veih. Tit: 3. 10.",
"Thus, in the case of the incestuous person, the apostle affirms that the Church hath a power to judge. In the case of an heretick which may be said to be the case of every /notorious/ [134] notorious relapsing sinner, he not only affirms the power, but also commands and enjoins them to put in force that power & authority.","Myrgheddyn, ayns cooish yn dooinney va kyndagh jeh croiagh, ta’n ostyl shickeragh dy vel pooar ec yn Aglish dy vrieunyss.

"Thus we may fully see & understand by what is said & inferred from the words of the New Testament, that excommunicated persons are expelled from being members of the Church, & are to be looked upon as heathens, who (as the apostle saith) are without, & cast forth out of the bosom of the Church.","Myr shoh foddee shin dy mieh faikin as toiggal liorish na ta er na ghra ass as veih goayn yn Tchimney Noa, dy vel ad shen ta er nan giarey magh ass yn Aglish er nan scarrey veih y ve oltyn jee, as dy ve er nan jieaghyn orroo myr anchreeisteenyn, ta (myr ta’n ostyl gra) mnoih, as tilgyt magh ass yn Aglish.",
"And if we will but consult the writers of the primitive Church, we shall find that excommunication deprived every notorious offender not only of the use /of/ [135] of the sacraments but also debarred them from entering the Church, or holding any correspondence with the faithful.","As my nee shin leigh lioryn va jieant ec toshiaght Creeisteeaght, yiouh shin dy ren giarey magh ass yn Aglish tcharba dy chooilley pheccagh va dy foshlyt mee chrauee cha nee na lomercan veih goayll ayrn jeh na sacramentyn /agh/ [135] agh myrgheddyn liettal ad veih goll stiagh ayns chieel, ny sheshaght ny dellal erbee y ve oc rish pabyl Dyee.",
"No man would eat with them, or so much as speak to them – but every one shunned them, as one would to persons infected with the plague. None but bishops or priests might converse with them & they only in order to bring them to repentance & amendment of life, so long as there was any hopes of it.","Cha jinnagh dooinney erbee giee maroo, ny wheeish as loayrt roo – agh ren dagh unaan tchea vouh, myr yinnagh ad veih persoonyn va’n chramp orroo.

"And when they were admitted to pennance, it was always done with discretion. They were made to understand that this was a favour, not over hastily to be granted, & therefore, /they/ [136] they took time to try whether their return was hearty & sincere.","As tra v’ad er nan lowal dy yiannoo pennass, ve kinjagh lesh kiarail wooar: ve er na hoilshagh dauh dy rou shen foayr, nagh voddagh y ve er na hoilsheshagh feer loa, as shen y fa, ren ad goayll traa dy /aikin/ [136] aikin rou yn tchinda oc veih’n chree as firrinagh my nagh rou.",
"It would be too tedious to recite how the penitent was kept upon tryal, & the many laborious exercises that were enjoined him.","Ghoigh e rouyr traa dy hoilshagh cres va’n peccagh freihlt dy hrial e, as na laan ryddyn thoigeilagh chi eh trooid.",
"But a perfect reconciliation to the Church was never granted, till they saw it sought for by tears, & merited by an effectual reformation of life and manners.","Agh cha rou eh er na ghoayll stiagh eddyr ayns shee slaan rish yn Aglish, derrey honnick ad e er na hirrey lesh jeyr, as er na hoilloo lesh slaan liassaghey bea as ymmyrkey mieh as aightail.",
Having hitherto heard the nature & extent of excommunication – Let us now briefly consider –,Lurg dooin ve myr shoh er chlashtyn dooghyss as roishtyn yn vrieunyss shoh jeh giarey magh ass yn Aglish. – Lig dooin nish smooinag{ht} er.,
2.  Who hath power to extend the sentence.,2.  Quoi ec ta pooar dy chur yn vrieunyss shen.,
