Stooghyn Neu-heeltail.[1],Re-translated into English by Wm. Kneen[2],"[1] neu-heeltail] ‘intoxicating’; not found elsewhere, and the expected form is neu-heeltoil.
[2] This piece was also printed in Mona’s Herald, Wednesday, March 18, 1885; Page: 8:  with the following introduction; “John Wesley’s Instructions To Methodists: The following condensed account of the principles laid down by John Wesley for the guidance of his followers, in regard to the Temperance question, was translated into Manx, for the Kirk Andreas Total Abstinence Society, in 1847, and circulated amongst its members. It has now been re-translated into English by Wm. Kneen, Town Missionary.” There is no known existing example of the first edition of ‘Ard-Firrinysyn’, but as the publishers Sherriff & Russell ceased trading in 1849, the second edition could only have been published between 1847 and 1849. As large parts of the piece are direct translations of Wesley’s or other’s writings, the translation given here follows those works where possible, and is not Wm. Kneen’s 1885 translation. The piece was also published, in serial form and with a different translation, in the Isle of Man Examiner’s Manx language Column in July, August and September of 1899."

Why does breadcorn bring so high a price?” It is chiefly through such quantities of corn destroyed by distilling.","[3] skyollyn] Cregeen: skyoll, s. f. a great deal, a large quantity.  
[4] shillail] cf. Kelly: ‘SHILLEY, v. to drop, to distil’, and see below. The form shillail is not found elsewhere.
[5] “Thought on the Present Scarcity of Provisions.” Wesley, John, printed by R. Hawes, London,. 1773. The English translation from ‘Why is food so dear? ...’ to ‘... of life and virtue’ is taken directly from this work."

Elsewhere we find cour-y-laa ‘daily’.
[7] The Manx gives 8,000 bushels, which equals 1,000 quarters (a quarter ton being a standard measurement for grain)."

Therefore we ought not to sell anything that will lead to ruin our health (or shorten our days), such as, in a great measure, is all the fiery-water drink (commonly called wholesale drinks, or intoxicating drinks).[13]","[12] jourym] not found elsewhere in the corpus; seems to be OED jorum: a. A large drinking-bowl or vessel; also, the contents of this; esp. a bowl of punch. And cf. ‘JOURUM. ‘jorum’ a large jug’ in Moore, A. W et al, Vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx Dialect.
