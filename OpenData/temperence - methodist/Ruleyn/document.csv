RULES of the SOCIETY.,RULEYN.,,
"1. In the latter end of the year 1739, eight or ten Persons came to Mr. Wesley in London, who appeared to be deeply convinced of sin and earnestly groaning for Redemption. ","Ayns jerrey’n Vlein un thousane shiaght cheead as nuy-jeig as feed, haink hoght ny jeih dy phersoonyn gys Mr. Wesley ayns Lunning va jeeaghin dy ve fo ennaghtyn dowin jeh nyn stayd peccoil, as gosnaghey son livreys. ",,
"They desired (as did two or three more the next day) that he would spend some time with them in prayer, and advise them how to flee from the wrath to come, which they saw continually hanging over their heads. ","Ren ad geearee (myr ren ghaa ny three elley yn laa er-giyn) dy jinnagh eh baarail tammylt dy hraa mâroo ayns padjer, as coyrle y chur daue kys dy chea veih’n chorree ta ry-heet, va’d fakin dy kinjagh croghey harrish nyn ghing. ",,
"That they might have more time for this great work, he appointed a day when they might all come together, which from thenceforward they did every week, viz. on Thursday in the evening.","Agh dy voddagh ny smoo dy hraa ’ve oc son yn obbyr vooar shoh, ren eh pointeil laa tra oddagh ad ooilley cheet cooidjagh; shen ren ad tannaghtyn dy yannoo lurg shen dy chooilley hiaghtin; ta shen er fastyr Jerdein. ",,
"To these, and as many more as desired to join with them, (for their number increased daily) he gave those advices from time to time which he judged most needful for them: and they always concluded the meeting with prayer, suited to their several necessities.","Daue shoh as da whilleen elley as va aigney ock dy lhiantyn mâroo, (son va’n earroo ock bishaghey gagh-laa.) hug eh lheid ny coyrleyn veih traa dy traa as ve briwnys smoo va ymmyrchagh er nyn son ock: as ren ad kinjagh cur jerrey er y cheet-cooidjagh ock lesh padjer cordail rish ny caghlaaghyn stayd ock. ",,
"2. This was the rise of the Methodist Society, first in London, and then in other places. Such a Society is no other than “A company of persons, who, having the Form, are seeking the Power of Godliness: United, in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation, and to watch over one another in love, that they may help each other to work out their Salvation.”(a)"," Shoh myr ren ny Methodistyn troggal seose hoshiaght ayns Lunning as eisht ayns ardjyn elley.

"There is only one condition previously required in those who request to be admitted into this Society, namely, A desire to flee from the wrath to come, to be saved from their sins: (b) But wherever this is really fixed in the soul, it will be shown by its fruits. (c)","Ynrican un red ta er ny hirrey jeh ooilley nyn lheid as ta geearree dy ve oltyn jeh’n Cheshaght shoh, roish my vod ad ve goit stiagh, ta shen, yeearree dy hea veih’n chorree ta ry-heet, dy ve sauit veih nyn beccaghyn.

"That it may the more easily be discerned, whether the members of the society are working out their Salvation, each society is divided into smaller companies, called Classes, according to their respective places of abode, or as it may suit their convenience. There are about twelve persons, or more, in each class; one of whom is stiled the Leader.","Dy vod tastey skeyrey ve currit da vel dy chooilley olt jeh’n Cheshaght cheddin gobbraghey magh nyn Saualtys, ta dagh Sheshaght er nyn rheinn ayns sheshaghtyn sloo enmyssit Classyn, cordail rish yn boayl raad ta lheid ny persoonyn vaghey, ny myr share ta gansoor daue hene.

"No person is admitted on trial, till he has met three or four times in a Class, and is recommended by a leader, or by a proper person, and receives a note from a travelling-preacher, and the rules of the society. ","Cha vel persoon erbee goit stiagh er trial, derrey t’eh er veeteil three ny kiare dy cheayrtyn ayns class as imraa er ny yannoo jeh myr fer ta cooie dy ve goit stiagh, liorish Leeideilagh class, ny persoon fondagh ennagh elley, as geddin scrieu veih’n Phreachoor ta troailt soilshaghey dy vel ad goaill-rish er trial marish ny ruleyn ta bentyn da’n Cheshaght.  ",,
"Having met two months on trial, and being recommended by the leader, he then receives a Ticket, and is considered as a member of the society.","Lurg da ve’r veeteil daa vee er trial, as er ny lowal jeh liorish yn Leeideilagh, te eisht geddin ticket, as ta jeeaghit er myr olt jeh’n Cheshaght.","Lurg da ve’r veeteil dy vee er trial, as er ny lowal jeh liorish yn Leeideilagh, te eisht geddin ticket, as ta jeeaghit er myr olt jeh’n Cheshaght.",
"Persons are received into society in large towns, on the Sunday following the quarterly visitation of the classes.

"A Leader ought to be a person of clear experience, and sound judgment, truly devoted to God, zealous for the salvation of souls, of upright conversation, and one who has gifts proper for the work.

"He is nominated by the superintendent, at a leader’s meeting, and if approved of by a majority of the leaders present, is confirmed in that office. ","Te er ny phointeil dy ve er ny hrial son yn oik cheddin, liorish yn preachoor ny’n shirveishagh ta jeeaghyn harrish cooishyn Methodistyn ayns y voayl shen ec meeteil jeh ny leeideilee; as my te lowit jeh liorish yn ayrn smoo jeh ny leeideilee kion-fenish, te er ny hickraghey ayns oik shen.

"It is the business of a leader to see all the persons belonging to his class once a week at least, in order to enquire how their souls prosper. Not only how they keep the Rules of the Society, but how they grow in the knowledge and love of God. To advise, reprove, comfort, or exhort, as occasion may require. To receive what they are willing to give toward the support of the Gospel.","Te currym leeideilagh class dy akin ooilley ny persoonyn bentyn gys e chlass keayrt ’sy chiaghtin ec [4] chooid sloo[4], dy vod eh fys gheddin er stayd ny hanmeenyn ock.

"To meet the Preacher and Stewards of the Society once a week, in order to inform the Preacher of any that are sick; or of any that walk disorderly, and will not be reproved, To pay to the Stewards what they have received of their several classes, and to show their account of what each person has contributed.","Dy veeteil yn Preachoor as Stiurtyn y Cheshaght keayrt ’sy chiaghtin, dy vod ad soilshaghey quoi ta ching nyn mast’ ock ; ny my ta fer erbee jeu nagh vel goll cordail rish-oardagh, as nagh bee coyrlit.

"    A Steward of the Society, ought to be an experienced christian, of upright conversation, and one who can write and keep fair accounts. He is chosen to his office at a quarterly, or at a leader’s meeting. He is then nominated by the superintendent, and if approved of by the majority of the persons present, is confirmed in his office for one year.","Lhisagh Stiurt jeh’n Cheshaght shoh, ve creestee jeh toiggal vie ayns y raad dy haualtys, jeh ymmyrkey bea ynrick, as fer oddys Scrieu as freayll coontaghyn kiart.
